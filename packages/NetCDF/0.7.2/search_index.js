    "text": "In this example we show how to create a NetCDF file from scratch, write some data to it and read it back in afterwards. First of all we create an array with top-of the atmosphere radiation data:using NetCDF\ninclude(joinpath(Pkg.dir(\"NetCDF\"),\"examples\",\"toa.jl\"))\n\n# Define longitudes and latitudes, day and timesteps\nlat=collect(-89.5:89.5)\nlon=collect(-179.5:179.5)\nday=1\ntim=collect(0:23)\n\n# Create radiation array\nrad = [g_pot(x2,x1,day,x3) for x1=lon, x2=lat, x3=tim];\nThe resulting array is a 3-dimensional array with dimensions lon-lat-time, resembling approximately the hourly top of atmosphere radiation on January 1st. For documentation purposes we want to add atributes to the variable as well as the dimensions. Throughout this package, attributes are represented Dict{String}s:varatts = Dict(\"longname\" => \"Radiation at the top of the atmosphere\",\n          \"units\"    => \"W/m^2\")\nlonatts = Dict(\"longname\" => \"Longitude\",\n          \"units\"    => \"degrees east\")\nlatatts = Dict(\"longname\" => \"Latitude\",\n          \"units\"    => \"degrees north\")\ntimatts = Dict(\"longname\" => \"Time\",\n          \"units\"    => \"hours since 01-01-2000 00:00:00\");Now we have all the meta-information ready to create the actual file:fn = joinpath(tempdir(),\"radiation.nc\")\nisfile(fn) && rm(fn)\nnccreate(fn,\"rad\",\"lon\",lon,lonatts,\"lat\",lat,latatts,\"time\",tim,timatts,atts=varatts);\nnothing # hideOnce the file is created we can write the actual data to it:ncwrite(rad,fn,\"rad\");This does not yet ensure that the data is actually written to the file, it might still be cached by the NetCDF library. In order to write and close the file we run ncclose:ncclose(fn)\nnothing # hideNow we assume we just retrieved this radiation NetCDF file and want to get some information about it. This is done using ncinfo:ncinfo(fn)Here we learn the most important information about the file, which variables it contains, the variable dimensions and their attributes. We decide to read the radiation variable:x=ncread(fn,\"rad\")\nsize(x)This reads the whole array at once. If we only want to read a certain part of the variable, for example if we only want to plot the time series at a certain location, we can use the start and count keywords:ts = ncread(fn,\"rad\",start=[180,45,1], count=[1,1,-1])In order to correctly label the time steps we retrieve the time information from the file:tvec = Base.Dates.DateTime(2001,1,1)+Base.Dates.Hour.(ncread(fn,\"time\"))Now we can generate the plot:plot(tvec,ts)Another example would be to generate a heatmap plot of the solar radiation at 12am UTC:lons = ncread(fn,\"lon\")\nlats = ncread(fn,\"lat\")\nm    = ncread(fn,\"rad\",start=[1,1,12],count=[-1,-1,1])\nplot(heatmap(x=lons,y=lats,z=m))"

The optional argument values is a 1D array of values that are written to the dimension variable and the optional argument atts is a Dict holding pairs of attribute names and values. Setting unlimited=true creates an unlimited dimension.After defining the dimensions, you can create NcVar objects withNcVar(varname , dimlist; atts=Dict{Any,Any}(), t=Float64, compress=-1)Here varname is the name of the variable, dimlist an array of type NcDim holding the dimensions associated to the variable, varattributes is a Dict holding pairs of attribute names and values. t is the data type that should be used for storing the variable.  You can either specify a Julia type(Int16, Int32, Float32, Float64) which will be translated to(NCSHORT, NCINT, NCFLOAT, NCDOUBLE) or directly specify one of the latter list. You can also set the compression level of the variable by setting compress to a number in the range 1..9 This has only an effect in netCDF4 files.Having defined the variables, the netCDF file can be created:netCDF.create(filename, varlist, gatts=Dict{Any,Any}(),mode=NC_netCDF4)Here, filename is the name of the file to be created and varlist an array of NcVar holding the variables that should appear in the file.

First, the dimensions of the NetCDF variables do not match the dimensions of the resulting string array because of the additional str_len (or similar) axis that is introduced in the NetCDF file. So an n-dimensional String-Array maps to an (n+1)-dimensional NC_CHAR array.Second, historically the NC_CHAR type has been used to store compressed data, too. So it is not always desirable to automatically convert these char arrays to strings. Anyhow, here is how you can deal with these variable types:Assume you have a NetCDF variable of type NC_CHAR of dimensions (str_len: 10, axis2: 20). Calling x=ncread(...) or x=readvar(...) on this variable will return an Array{UInt8,2} with size (10,20) as it is represented on disk. If you You can either use this data directly (if it is numeric) or convert them to a Vector{String} by callingy=nc_char2string(x)which will return a string vector of length 20.An example for creating NC_CHAR and writing variables would be the following:nccreate(filename,varname,\"str_len\",20,\"DimValues\",5,t=NC_CHAR)\nxs = [\"a\",\"bb\",\"ccc\",\"dddd\",\"eeeee\"]\nncwrite(filename,varname,nc_string2char(xs))The call of string2char will convert the Vector{String} to a Matrix{UInt8}. which can be written to the NetCDF file."
