# GetCostAndUsage Operation

Retrieves cost and usage metrics for your account. You can specify which cost and usage-related metric, such as `BlendedCosts` or `UsageQuantity`, that you want the request to return. You can also filter and group your data by various dimensions, such as `SERVICE` or `AZ`, in a specific time range. For a complete list of valid dimensions, see the `[GetDimensionValues](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_GetDimensionValues.html)` operation. Master accounts in an organization in AWS Organizations have access to all member accounts.

# Arguments

## `TimePeriod = [ ... ]`
Sets the start and end dates for retrieving AWS costs. The start date is inclusive, but the end date is exclusive. For example, if `start` is `2017-01-01` and `end` is `2017-05-01`, then the cost and usage data is retrieved from `2017-01-01` up to and including `2017-04-30` but not including `2017-05-01`.
```
 TimePeriod = [
        "Start" => <required> ::String,
        "End" => <required> ::String
    ]
```

## `Granularity = "DAILY" or "MONTHLY"`
Sets the AWS cost granularity to `MONTHLY` or `DAILY`. If `Granularity` isn't set, the response object doesn't include the `Granularity`, either `MONTHLY` or `DAILY`.


## `Filter = [ ... ]`
Filters AWS costs by different dimensions. For example, you can specify `SERVICE` and `LINKED_ACCOUNT` and get the costs that are associated with that account's usage of that service. You can nest `Expression` objects to define any combination of dimension filters. For more information, see [Expression](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_Expression.html).
```
 Filter = [
        "Or" =>  [structure, ...],
        "And" =>  [structure, ...],
        "Not" =>  structure,
        "Dimensions" =>  [
            "Key" =>  "AZ", "INSTANCE_TYPE", "LINKED_ACCOUNT", "OPERATION", "PURCHASE_TYPE", "REGION", "SERVICE", "USAGE_TYPE", "USAGE_TYPE_GROUP", "RECORD_TYPE", "OPERATING_SYSTEM", "TENANCY", "SCOPE", "PLATFORM", "SUBSCRIPTION_ID", "LEGAL_ENTITY_NAME", "DEPLOYMENT_OPTION", "DATABASE_ENGINE", "CACHE_ENGINE" or "INSTANCE_TYPE_FAMILY",
            "Values" =>  [::String, ...]
        ],
        "Tags" =>  [
            "Key" =>  ::String,
            "Values" =>  [::String, ...]
        ]
    ]
```

## `Metrics = [::String, ...]`
Which metrics are returned in the query. For more information about blended and unblended rates, see [Why does the "blended" annotation appear on some line items in my bill?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/blended-rates-intro/).

Valid values are `AmortizedCost`, `BlendedCost`, `UnblendedCost`, and `UsageQuantity`.

**Note**
> If you return the `UsageQuantity` metric, the service aggregates all usage numbers without taking into account the units. For example, if you aggregate `usageQuantity` across all of EC2, the results aren't meaningful because EC2 compute hours and data transfer are measured in different units (for example, hours vs. GB). To get more meaningful `UsageQuantity` metrics, filter by `UsageType` or `UsageTypeGroups`.

`Metrics` is required for `GetCostAndUsage` requests.


## `GroupBy = [[ ... ], ...]`
You can group AWS costs using up to two different groups, either dimensions, tag keys, or both.

When you group by tag key, you get all tag values, including empty strings.

Valid values are `AZ`, `INSTANCE_TYPE`, `LEGAL_ENTITY_NAME`, `LINKED_ACCOUNT`, `OPERATION`, `PLATFORM`, `PURCHASE_TYPE`, `SERVICE`, `TAGS`, `TENANCY`, and `USAGE_TYPE`.
```
 GroupBy = [[
        "Type" =>  "DIMENSION" or "TAG",
        "Key" =>  ::String
    ], ...]
```

## `NextPageToken = ::String`
The token to retrieve the next set of results. AWS provides the token when the response from a previous call has more results than the maximum page size.




# Returns

`GetCostAndUsageResponse`

# Exceptions

`LimitExceededException`, `BillExpirationException`, `DataUnavailableException`, `InvalidNextTokenException` or `RequestChangedException`.

# GetReservationCoverage Operation

Retrieves the reservation coverage for your account. This allows you to see how much of your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon ElastiCache, Amazon Relational Database Service, or Amazon Redshift usage is covered by a reservation. An organization's master account can see the coverage of the associated member accounts. For any time period, you can filter data about reservation usage by the following dimensions:

*   AZ

*   CACHE_ENGINE

*   DATABASE_ENGINE

*   DEPLOYMENT_OPTION

*   INSTANCE_TYPE

*   LINKED_ACCOUNT

*   OPERATING_SYSTEM

To determine valid values for a dimension, use the `GetDimensionValues` operation.

# Arguments

## `TimePeriod = [ ... ]` -- *Required*
The start and end dates of the period for which you want to retrieve data about reservation coverage. You can retrieve data for a maximum of 13 months: the last 12 months and the current month. The start date is inclusive, but the end date is exclusive. For example, if `start` is `2017-01-01` and `end` is `2017-05-01`, then the cost and usage data is retrieved from `2017-01-01` up to and including `2017-04-30` but not including `2017-05-01`.

# GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation Operation

Gets recommendations for which reservations to purchase. These recommendations could help you reduce your costs. Reservations provide a discounted hourly rate (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand pricing.

AWS generates your recommendations by identifying your On-Demand usage during a specific time period and collecting your usage into categories that are eligible for a reservation. After AWS has these categories, it simulates every combination of reservations in each category of usage to identify the best number of each type of RI to purchase to maximize your estimated savings.

For example, AWS automatically aggregates your EC2 Linux, shared tenancy, and c4 family usage in the US West (Oregon) Region and recommends that you buy size-flexible regional reservations to apply to the c4 family usage. AWS recommends the smallest size instance in an instance family. This makes it easier to purchase a size-flexible RI. AWS also shows the equal number of normalized units so that you can purchase any instance size that you want. For this example, your RI recommendation would be for `c4.large`, because that is the smallest size instance in the c4 instance family.

# Arguments

## `AccountId = ::String`
The account ID that is associated with the recommendation.


## `Service = ::String` -- *Required*
The specific service that you want recommendations for.


## `AccountScope = "PAYER" or "LINKED"`
The account scope that you want recommendations for. `PAYER` means that AWS includes the master account and any member accounts when it calculates its recommendations. `LINKED` means that AWS includes only member accounts when it calculates its recommendations.

Valid values are `PAYER` and `LINKED`.


## `LookbackPeriodInDays = "SEVEN_DAYS", "THIRTY_DAYS" or "SIXTY_DAYS"`
The number of previous days that you want AWS to consider when it calculates your recommendations.


## `TermInYears = "ONE_YEAR" or "THREE_YEARS"`
The reservation term that you want recommendations for.


## `PaymentOption = "NO_UPFRONT", "PARTIAL_UPFRONT", "ALL_UPFRONT", "LIGHT_UTILIZATION", "MEDIUM_UTILIZATION" or "HEAVY_UTILIZATION"`
The reservation purchase option that you want recommendations for.


## `ServiceSpecification = ["EC2Specification" =>  ["OfferingClass" =>  "STANDARD" or "CONVERTIBLE"]]`
The hardware specifications for the service instances that you want recommendations for, such as standard or convertible EC2 instances.


## `PageSize = ::Int`
