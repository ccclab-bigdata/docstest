    "text": "(Image: Build Status) (Image: codecov.io) (Image: ) (Image: )RigidBodyDynamics.jl is a rigid body dynamics library in pure Julia. It aims to be user friendly and performant, but also generic in the sense that the algorithms can be called with inputs of any (suitable) scalar types. This means that if fast numeric dynamics evaluations are required, a user can supply Float64 or Float32 inputs. However, if symbolic quantities are desired for analysis purposes, they can be obtained by calling the algorithms with e.g. SymPy.Sym inputs. If gradients are required, e.g. the ForwardDiff.Dual type, which implements forward-mode automatic differentiation, can be used.See the latest stable documentation for a list of features, installation instructions, and a quick-start guide. Installation should only take a couple of minutes, including installing Julia itself. See the notebooks directory for some usage examples."

It includes a brief demo of RigidBodyDynamics.jl and RigidBodyTreeInspector.jl. Note that RigidBodyDynamics.jl performance has significantly improved since this talk. The margins of the slides have unfortunately been cut off somewhat in the video.\nAugust 22, 2017: tagged version 0.3.0. Drops Julia 0.5 support.\nJune 18, 2017: tagged version 0.2.0. Supports Julia 0.6. This is the last version to support Julia 0.5.\nMarch 20, 2017: tagged version 0.1.0.\nFebruary 16, 2017: tagged version 0.0.6.\nFebruary 14, 2017: tagged version 0.0.5.\nDecember 12, 2016: tagged version 0.0.4.\nDecember 6, 2016: tagged version 0.0.3.\nOctober 28, 2016: tagged version 0.0.2.\nOctober 24, 2016: tagged version 0.0.1."
