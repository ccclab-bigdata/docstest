    "text": "Modia3D is a Julia package to model fixed and moving objects in 3D (e.g. visual shapes, rigid bodies). These objects are driven kinematically by pre-defined time functions or are moving dynamically by solving Differential Algebraic Equations (DAEs) with a variable-step DAE solver.Collision handling with elastic response calculation is performed for objects that are defined with a contact material and (a) have a convex geometry, or (b) can be approximated by a set of convex geometries, or (c) have a concave geometry that is (automatically) approximated by its convex hull. Papers about Modia3D:Collision Handling with Variable-Step Integrators (EOOLT 2017, December)\nComponent-Based 3D Modeling Combined with Equation-Based Modeling, accepted for publication at the American Modelica Conference 2018, October 9-10Before releasing version 1.0, Modia3D shall be easily combinable with Modia, for example to define a controlled electrical motor with Modia, and add 3D behavior/visualization with Modia3D. By this approach the best of both worlds can be combined: Special 3D algorithms (Modia3D) + power/flexibility of equation based modeling (Modia)."

    "text": "Object3D definitions can be collected together with the Modia3D.@assembly macro in hierarchical structures. For example, in the following four bar mechanism (consisting of 3 bars and the ground as 4th bar), a bar is defined as an assembly consisting of a light-blue SolidBeam Object3D and two red Cylinder Object3Ds. Such a bar is then in turn assembled in the assembly FourBar shown below:(Image: fourbar)There are the following operations on an instance of an assembly:Modia3D.visualizeAssembly!(assembly) to visualize the initial configuration of the assembly without simulating anything.\nModia3D.SimulationModel(assembly; analysis=xxx, <other arguments>) to generate a simulationModel of the assembly that can be simulated with ModiaMath.simulate!. The analysis keyword defines which analysis shall be carried out on the model. Currently supported are KinematicAnalysis to kinematically move the assembly, or DynamicAnalysis to solve the equations of motion of the assembly. In the future it is planned to support QuasiStaticAnalysis as well."

ModiaMath in turn uses PyPlot as basis for the plotting. Since installation of PyPlot is not robust with the automatic installation procedure of current Julia, it is recommended to first install PyPlot as described in the installation procedure of ModiaMath.Modia3D visualizes the movement of 3D objects with a renderer. Currently, the (free) community or the (commercial) professional version of the DLR Visualization library are supported. To install the free version for Windows perform the following steps (the free Linux version will become available in a few days):Go to https://visualization.ltx.de/, provide your contact information and click on Request download for Community Edition. Afterwards, you get a link to download the library and you need to unzip the file.\nIn your HOME/.juliarc.jl file, include the environment variable ENV[\"DLR_VISUALIZATION\"] = \"<path-to-library>/Visualization/Extras/SimVis\".\nStart Julia and run one of the examples, for example include(\"$(Modia3D.path)/examples/dynamics/Simulate_DoublePendulumWithDampers.jl\")If Modia3D cannot use one of the renderers above, it will continue with renderer NoRenderer that is animation is switched off."
