    "text": "(Image: Build Status) (Image: LLLplus)Lattice reduction and related lattice tools are used in wireless communication, cryptography, and mathematics.  This package provides the following tools: Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovacsz (LLL) lattice reduction, Seysen lattice reduction, a sphere decoder, and VBLAST matrix decomposition. This package was created as a way to explore the Julia language, and is not intended to be a cannonical tool for lattice reduction; use at your own risk! :-)LLL [1] lattice reduction is a powerful tool in computer science that is used to cryptanalysis of public-key systems, to solve quadratic equations, and to solve other linear problems such as in multi-terminal wireless. The LLL is often used as a bounded-complexity approximate solution to the shortest vector problem (SVP). Seysen [2] introduced a lattice reduction which focuses on global optimization rather than local optimization as in LLL. The closest vector problem (CVP) is related to the SVP; in the context of multi-antenna decoding it is referred to as sphere-decoding.Finally, we include code to do a V-BLAST (Vertical-Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time) matrix decomposition. This decomposition is used in a detection algorithm [3] for decoding spatially-multiplexed streams of data on multiple antennas or other multi-terminal systems. V-BLAST is not as widely used outside of the wireless communication community as lattice reduction and CVP techniques such as the sphere decoder. In the Julia package MUMIMO.jl we use the LLL, sphere-decoder, and V-BLAST functions in this package to decode multi-user, multi-antenna signals."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "On this page we give a few performance results obtained from the following command in the top-level LLLplus directory: julia -e \'include(\"benchmark/perftest.jl\")\' In the tests we time execution of the lattice-reduction functions, average the results over multiple random matrices, and show results as a function of the size of the matrix and of the data type. We first show how the time varies with matrix size (1,2,4,...64); the vertical axis shows execution time on a logarithmic scale; the x-axis is also logarithmic. The generally linear nature of the LLL curve supports the polynomial-time nature of the algorithm. Each data point is the average of execution time of 10 runs of a lattice-reduction technique, where the matrices used were generated using \'randn\' to emulate unit-variance Gaussian-distributed values. (Image: Time vs matrix size)Though the focus of the package is on floating-point,  all the modules can handle a variety of data types. In the next figure we show execution time for several datatypes (Int32, Int64, Int128, Float64, BitInt, and BigFloat) which are used to generate 100 4x4 matrices, over which execution time for the lattice reduction techniques is averaged.  The vertical axis is a logarithmic representation of execution time as in the previous figure. (Image: Time vs data type)"

    "text": "Possible improvements include:Change from \"LLLplus\" to \"LLLtoy\" or some such to emphasize the nature of this package.\nAdd Block-Korkin-Zolotarev lattice redution, with improvements   as in [4], and Brun lattice reduction \nThe SVP Challenge and the Ideal Lattice challenge have code to generate lattices for the respective contests which could be used or duplicated to make challenging performance tests. The main Lattice Challenge also lists references which could be used to replicate tests.\nCompare with the Number Theory Library."
