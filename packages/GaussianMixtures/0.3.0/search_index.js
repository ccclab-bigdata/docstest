    "text": "(Image: Build Status) This package contains support for Gaussian Mixture Models.  Basic training, likelihood calculation, model adaptation, and i/o are implemented.This Julia type is more specific than Dahua Lin\'s MixtureModels, in that it deals only with normal (multivariate) distributions (a.k.a Gaussians), but it does so more efficiently, hopefully.  We have support for switching between GMM and MixtureModels types. At this moment, we have implemented both diagonal covariance and full covariance GMMs, and full covariance variational Bayes GMMs.  In training the parameters of a GMM using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, the inner loop (computing the Baum-Welch statistics) can be executed efficiently using Julia\'s standard parallelization infrastructure, e.g., by using SGE.  We further support very large data (larger than will fit in the combined memory of the computing cluster) though BigData, which has now been incorporated in this package. "

    "text": "Some remarks on the dimension.  There are three main indexing variables:The Gaussian index \nThe data point\nThe feature dimension (for full covariance this adds to two dimensions)Often data is stored in 2D slices, and computations can be done efficiently as  matrix multiplications.  For this it is nice to have the data in standard row,column order.  However, we can\'t have these consistently over all three indexes. My approach is to have:The data index (i) always be a the first (row) index\nThe feature dimension index (k) always to be a the second (column) index\nThe Gaussian index (j) to be mixed, depending on how it is combined with either dimension above. The consequence is that \"data points run down\" in a matrix, just like records do in a DataFrame.  Hence, statistics per feature dimension occur consecutive in memory which may be advantageous for caching efficiency.  On the other hand, features belonging to the same data point are separated in memory, which probably is not according to the way they are generated, and does not extend to streamlined implementation.  The choice in which direction the data must run is an almost philosophical problem that I haven\'t come to a final conclusion about.  Please note that the choice for \"data points run down\" is the opposite of the convention used in Distributions.jl, so if you convert GMMs to MixtureModels in order to benefit from the methods provided for these distributions, you need to transpose the data.

The method :split works by initializing a single Gaussian with the data x and subsequently splitting the Gaussians followed by retraining using the EM algorithm until n Gaussians are obtained.  n must be a power of 2 for method=:split.  nIter is the number of iterations in the EM algorithm, and nFinal the number of iterations in the final step.
