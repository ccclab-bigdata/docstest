    "category": "section",
    "text": "embed(G,method) creates a new embedding of G. The second argument method is a symbol associated with an embedding algorithm. The method can be one of the following::circular (default) arranges the vertices in a circle.\n:random arranges the vertices at random.\n:spring arranges the vertices by modeling edges as springs holding repelling vertices together.\n:stress arranges the vertices by attempting to put vertices geometric distance equal to their graph-theoretic distance.\n:combined is equivalent to first performing a spring embedding followed by a stress embedding. Often gives nice results.\n:spectral arranges the vertices based on the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix of the graph. Specifically, the x-coordinates come from the eigenvectorassociated with the second smallest eigenvalue, and the y-coordinates come from the eigenvector associated with the third smallest.In addition, embed(G,xy) will give the graph an embedding specified in the dictionary xy where maps vertices to two-element vectors."

Defaults to \"black\".\nget_line_color(G) returns the line color.\nset_fill_color(G,name) assigns the color in the string name to be the fill color of the vertices. Defaults to \"white\".\nset_vertex_size(G,sz) sets the size of the drawn vertices tothe integer sz.get_vertex_size(G) returns the size of the vertices.\ntransform(G,A,b) applies an affine transformation to all coordinates in the graph\'s drawing. Here A is 2-by-2 matrix and b is a 2-vector. Each point p is mapped to A*p+b. Specialversions of this command are provided by scale, rotate, translate, and recenter. (Note: Some of these function names cause collisions, so I may change them.)edge_length(G,uv) returns the geometric length of the edge uv. Note this fails if G does not have an embedding.edge_length(G) returns an array of the edge lengths."
