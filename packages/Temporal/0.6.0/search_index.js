    "text": "One of the chief aims of the Temporal.jl package is to simplify the process of extracting a desired subset from a time series dataset. To that end, there are quite a few different methods by which one can index specific rows/columns of a TS object.One goal has been to keep as much of the relevant indexing operations from the base Array type as possible to maintain consistency. However, there are certain indexing idioms that are specifically more familiar and meaningful to tabular time series data, particularly when prototyping in the REPL.In other words, if you want to use standard Array indexing syntax, it should work as you would expect, but you should also be able to essentially say, \"give me all the observations from the year 2017 in the price column.\""
