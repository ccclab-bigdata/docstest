Juniper solves these kind of problems using a NLP solver and then branch and bound. If the NLP solver isn\'t global optimal then Juniper is a heuristic.  You need the global optimum?

The solver itself can have parameters i.e print_level=0.JuMP supports a lot of different NLP solvers (open source as well as commercial). A list of some NLP solvers is mentioned hereYou can add options doing the following:m = Model()\njuniper = JuniperSolver(IpoptSolver(print_level=0);\n    branch_strategy=:StrongPseudoCost\n)\nsetsolver(m, juniper)In this example the strategy used for branching is defined.In the following the options are explained.

If there is no warning like Real objective wasn\'t solved to optimality afterwards there is no need to worry at all. Normally in the end of the feasibility pump the real objective is used to improve the  objective value. If this is possible the warning before can be ignored as it is given that the solution has no rounding issues.  If this can\'t be done a warning like Real objective wasn\'t solved to optimality is thrown. This means that the objective might be not the best possible given the mip solution and if a warning for the tolerance change was thrown there might be rounding issues.
