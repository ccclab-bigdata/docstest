    "text": "BufferedInputStream(open(filename)) # wrap an IOStream\nBufferedInputStream(rand(UInt8, 100)) # wrap a byte arrayBufferedInputStream wraps a source. A source can be any IO object, but more specifically it can be any type T that implements a function:BufferedStreams.readbytes!(source::T, buffer::Vector{UInt8}, from::Int, to::Int)This function should write new data to buffer starting at position from and not exceeding position to and return the number of bytes written.BufferedInputStream is itself an IO type and implements the source type so you can use it like any other IO type.Calling close propagates to the underlying source object if applicable; once you wrap an IO object with a buffered stream, you can automatically close it by calling close on the buffered stream. Hence, if you are using a source that requires closing of an underlying system resource like file IO or socket, ensure you implement a close method in your source. This may be important for on-access locking file systems as in the MS Windows OS."

    "title": "Anchors",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Input streams also have some tricks to make parsing applications easier. When parsing data incrementally, one must take care that partial matches are preserved across buffer refills. One easy way to do this is to copy it to a temporary buffer, but this unecessary copying can slow things down.Input streams instead support the notion of \"anchoring\", which instructs the stream to save the current position in the buffer. If the buffer gets refilled, then any data in the buffer including or following that position gets shifted over to make room. When the match is finished, one can then call takeanchored! return an array of the bytes from the anchored position to the currened position, or upanchor! to return the index of the anchored position in the buffer.# print all numbers literals from a stream\nstream = BufferedInputStream(source)\nwhile !eof(stream)\n    b = peek(stream)\n    if \'1\' <= b <= \'9\'\n        if !isanchored(stream)\n            anchor!(stream)\n        end\n    elseif isanchored(stream)\n        println(ASCIIString(takeanchored!(stream)))\n    end\n    read(stream, UInt8)\nend"

It also works on any writable IO type, as well the more specific sink interface:writebytes(sink::T, buffer::Vector{UInt8}, n::Int, eof::Bool)This function should consume the first n bytes of buffer. The eof argument is used to indicate that there will be no more input to consume. It should return the number of bytes written, which must be n or 0. A return value of 0 indicates data was processed but should not be evicted from the buffer."
