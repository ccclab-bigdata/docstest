The DemuxLogger sends the logs to multiple different loggers. The FilteredLogger lets you add rules to cause a logger to ignore some inputs.By combining DemuxLogger with FilteredLoggers you can arbitrarily route log messages, wherever you want.The FileLogger is just a convience wrapper around the base julia SimpleLogger, to make it easier to pass in a filename, rather than a stream."

Or you can do, by wrapping them in a FilteredLogger as discussed below.The FileLogger does logging to file. It is really simple. It takes a filename; and the minimum level it should log."
