    "category": "section",
    "text": "Polyhedra is a package for polyhedra manipulations in Julia. It provides an unified interface for Polyhedra Manipulation Libraries such as CDDLib.jl, LRSLib.jl and QHull.Polyhedra can either be represented by a set of linear inequalities or by vertices and rays. In the first case, the points of the polyhedron are the points that satisfies all the inequalities and in the second case they are the points that can be expressed as a convex combination of the vertices plus a conic combination of the rays. The manipulations that Polyhedra can perform includeProjection: Projection of a polyhedron on a lower dimensional space, e.g. Fourier-Motzkin elimination.\nChanging the Representation\nVertex enumeration problem: Computing the extremal vertices and rays from an inequality representation\nConvex hull problem: Computing a set of linear inequalities describing the polyhedron from a vertex/ray representation\nRemoval of redundant inequalities or redundant vertices/rays.\nPlotting of 2D polyhedra using Plots\nDecomposition of 3D polyhedra into vertices and triangular faces, enabling easy visualization of 3D polyhedra using DrakeVisualizer or GLVisualize.Depending on the library, these manipulation can either be in floating point or exact rational arithmetic.Each operation has a default fallback implementation which is used in case the library does not support it. Polyhedra also includes a default library which does not implement anything, hence using every fallback.Polyhedra remains under active development, and we welcome your feedback, suggestions, and bug reports."

    "text": "As seen in the previous section, a polyhedron can be described in 2 ways: either using the H-representation (intersection of halfspaces) or the V-representation (convex hull of points and rays). The problem of computing the H-representation from the V-representation (or vice versa) is called the representation conversion problem. It can be solved by the Double-Description methoddoubledescriptionHowever, other methods exist such as the reverse search implemented by LRS and the quick hull algorithm implemented by qhull.This motivates the creation of a type representing polyhedra, transparently handling the conversion from H-representation to V-representation when needed for some operation. Just like the abstract type AbstractArray{N,T} represents an N-dimensional array with elements of type T, the abstract type Polyhedron{N,T} represents an N-dimensional polyhedron with elements of coefficient type T.There is typically one concrete subtype of Polyhedron by library. For instance, the CDD library defines CDDLib.Polyhedron and the LRS library defines LRSLib.Polyhedron. It must be said that the type T is not necessarily how the elements are stored internally by the library but the polyhedron will behave just like it is stored that way. For instance, when retreiving an H-(or V-)representation, the representation will be of type T. Therefore using Int for T may result in InexactError. For this reason, by default, the type T chosen is not a subtype of Integer.A polyhedron can be created from a representation and a library using the polyhedron function.polyhedronTo illustrate the usage of the polyhedron function, consider the following representations:hr = HalfSpace([1, 1], 1) ∩ HalfSpace([1, -1], 0) ∩ HalfSpace([-1, 0], 0)\nvre = convexhull([0, 0], [0, 1], [1//2, 1//2])\nvrf = convexhull([0, 0], [0, 1], [1/2, 1/2])One can use the CDD library, to create an instance of a concrete subtype of Polyhedron as follows:julia> using CDDLib\njulia> polyf = polyhedron(hr, CDDLib.Library())\njulia> typeof(polyhf)\nCDDLib.CDDLib.Polyhedron{2,Float64}We see that the library has choosen to deal with floating point arithmetic. This decision does not depend on the type of hr but only on the instance of CDDLib.Library given. CDDLib.Library creates CDDLib.Polyhedron of type either Float64 or Rational{BigInt}. One can choose the first one using CDDLib.Library(:float) and the second one using CDDLib.Library(:exact), by default it is :float.julia> poly = polyhedron(hr, CDDLib.Library(:exact))\njulia> typeof(poly)\nCDDLib.Polyhedron{2,Rational{BigInt}}The first polyhedron polyf can also be created from its V-representation using either of the 4 following lines:julia> polyf = polyhedron(vrf, CDDLib.Library(:float))\njulia> polyf = polyhedron(vrf, CDDLib.Library())\njulia> polyf = polyhedron(vre,  CDDLib.Library(:float))\njulia> polyf = polyhedron(vre,  CDDLib.Library())and poly using either of those lines:julia> poly = polyhedron(vrf, CDDLib.Library(:exact))\njulia> poly = polyhedron(vre, CDDLib.Library(:exact))Of course, creating a representation in floating points with exact arithmetic works here because we have 0.5 which is 0.1 in binary but in general, is not a good idea.julia> Rational{BigInt}(1/2)\n1//2\njulia> Rational{BigInt}(1/3)\n6004799503160661//18014398509481984\njulia> Rational{BigInt}(1/5)\n3602879701896397//18014398509481984"

    "text": "Consider the polyhedron created in the beginning of this section. As a reminder, it represents the following H-representation:beginalign*\n  x_1 + x_2 leq 1 \n  x_1 - x_2 leq 0 \n  x_1  geq 0\nendalign*One can verify that for any 0 leq x_2 leq 1, there exists a value x_1 such that (x_1 x_2) is in this polyhedron. This means that the H-representation obtained by eliminating x_1 is:beginalign*\n  x_1  leq 1 \n  x_1  geq 0\nendalign*where x_1 in the H-representation above represents x_2 in the previous one. This can be obtained as followsjulia> poly_x2 = eliminate(poly, [1])\njulia> hrep(poly_x2)\nH-representation\nbegin\n 2 2 rational\n 1//1 -1//1\n 0//1 1//1\nendThere is two methods of computing the elimination implemented in CDDLib: Fourier-Motzkin elimination and block elimination. As written by K. Fukuda in CDD\'s documentation, \"[Block elimination] might be a faster way to eliminate variables than the repeated [Fourier-Motzkin elimination] when the number of variables to eliminate is large\". You can specify the method to use as a third argument, e.g. eliminate(poly, [1], FourierMotzkin()), eliminate(poly, [1], BlockElimination()). A third method can be chosen: ProjectGenerators. It computes the V-representation and then project each of its elements. This is the method of choice when the V-representation is already computed.FourierMotzkin\nBlockElimination\nProjectGeneratorsIf nothing is specified as in the block of code above, the behavior depends on the polyhedral library. If neither Fourier-Motzkin nor block elimination is implemented or if the V-representation is already computed then :ProjectGenerators is chosen. Otherwise, Polyhedra lets the library decide. In CDDLib, :FourierMotzkin is chosen when only the last dimension needs to be eliminated and :BlockElimination is chosen otherwise. Note that CDDLib only supports projecting the last trailing dimensions.eliminate\nproject\nfixandeliminate"

    "text": "A typical application of polyhedral computation is the computation of the set of extreme points and rays of the feasible set of an optimization problem. This comes from the fact that given a minimization of a concave function (or maximization of a convex function) on a convex feasible set (e.g. Linear Programming), we are either in the following three situations:The feasible set is empty, i.e. the problem is infeasible.\nAn extreme ray is optimal, i.e. the problem is unbounded (or it may also be bounded if the objective is constant along the ray).\nAn extreme point is optimal.A JuMP model is treated by polyhedron just like any H-representation. For example, the hypercube of dimension n can be created as followsm = Model()\n@variable(m, 0 ≤ x[1:n] ≤ 1)\n\npoly = polyhedron(m, CDDLib.Library(:exact))In fact, the MathProgBase representation of the feasible set of a linear program:beginalign*\n  lb leq Ax leq ub\n  l leq x leq u\nendalign*has LPHRepresentation as a corresponding H-representation. A JuMP model can be converted to this representation using LPHRepresentation(m)."
