    "text": "Make-like behavior to facilitate writing long-running scripts. The idea is that the user supplies the dependencies between targets and recipes for how to make a target from those dependencies. If changes happen to one recipe (cf. if one edits one source file in a make project), only affected variables will be recomputed.Upon computation, a backup is written to disk. This means that even when the work on the script is resumed in a different session (because you went home, julia crashed, you ran out of memory, you share the data with coworkers over e.g. Dropbox), only missing and out-of-date targets will be recomputed.This saves a lot of time and unnecessary reruns of computations. It also relieves the programmer of having to track all dependencies and keep a clear picture of the workspace in their head."

Upon calling @make D all targets D depends on are built. Copies are written to disk in case we want to continue work in a future julia session. Assuming this is the first run ever (i.e. no copies on disk exist), the script results in the following output:[ Info: level 1 dep A: computed from dependencies [initial computation].\n[ Info: level 1 dep B: computed from dependencies [initial computation].\n[ Info: level 2 dep A: retrieved from memory cache.\n[ Info: level 2 dep B: retrieved from memory cache.\n[ Info: level 1 dep C: computed from dependencies [initial computation].\n[ Info: level 0 dep D: computed from dependencies [initial computation].\n--- Recipe for B modified! ---\n[ Info: level 1 dep A: retrieved from memory cache.\n[ Info: level 1 dep B: computed from dependencies [initial computation].\n[ Info: level 2 dep A: retrieved from memory cache.\n[ Info: level 2 dep B: retrieved from memory cache.\n[ Info: level 1 dep C: computed from dependencies [memory cache out-of-date].\n[ Info: level 0 dep D: computed from dependencies [memory cache out-of-date]Note in particular that modifiying target B has the desired effect of recomputing B,C,D. An immediate second run will not require A to be recomputed, but B,C,D will, because we reverted to the original recipe for B:[ Info: level 1 dep A: retrieved from memory cache.\n[ Info: level 1 dep B: computed from dependencies [initial computation].\n[ Info: level 2 dep A: retrieved from memory cache.\n[ Info: level 2 dep B: retrieved from memory cache.\n[ Info: level 1 dep C: computed from dependencies [memory cache out-of-date].\n[ Info: level 0 dep D: computed from dependencies [memory cache out-of-date].\n--- Recipe for B modified! ---\n[ Info: level 1 dep A: retrieved from memory cache.\n[ Info: level 1 dep B: computed from dependencies [initial computation].\n[ Info: level 2 dep A: retrieved from memory cache.\n[ Info: level 2 dep B: retrieved from memory cache.\n[ Info: level 1 dep C: computed from dependencies [memory cache out-of-date].\n[ Info: level 0 dep D: computed from dependencies [memory cache out-of-date].Likewise, killing the session and running the script again will see A restored from disk, but the other targets are recomputed twice (one for each version of the recipe for B):Julia has exited.

    "text": "Recipe validity is tracked by storing the hash of the corresponding julia Expr\nThe @target macro creates a variable target_A etc. in the module namespace, excluding these names as valid variable names in your script.\nRecipes resulting in nothing are not valid as nothing indicates absence of an in-memory cached value.\nUp-dates to normal non-target variables are not tracked and changes to them will not trigger recomputation of dependents. Functions taking zero arguments and returning a constant value are the appropriate way to allow for changeable parameters."
