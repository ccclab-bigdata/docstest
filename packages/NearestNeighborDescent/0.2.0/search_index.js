    "text": "The DescentGraph constructor builds the approximate kNN graph:DescentGraph(data, n_neighbors, metric; max_iters, sample_rate, precision)data: The set of points to build the tree from. This must be of typeVector{V}, where V <: AbstractVector or AbstractMatrix.n_neighbors: An integer specifies the number of neighbors to find\nmetric: Any metric M where M <: SemiMetric from the Distances.jl package. Default is Euclidean().The performance of NN Descent can be tuned with several keyword arguments.max_iters: This controls the maximum number of iterations to search forneighbors. Default is 10.sample_rate: The algorithm performs a local join around the candidateneighbors of each point during execution. The sample rate is the likelihood that each candidate be included in the local join for an iteration. Default is 1..precision: This argument roughly corresponds to the fraction of truenearest neighbors that will be missed by the algorithm. Default .001.The k-nearest neighbors can be accessed through the indices and distances attributes. These are both KxN matrices containing ids and distances to each point\'s neighbors, respectively, where K = n_neighbors and N = length(data).Example:using NearestNeighborDescent\ndata = [rand(10) for _ in 1:1000]\n# OR data = rand(10, 1000)\nn_neighbors = 5\n\n# nn descent search\ngraph = DescentGraph(data, n_neighbors)\n\n# access point i\'s jth nearest neighbor:\ngraph.indices[j, i]\ngraph.distances[j, i]Once constructed, the DescentGraph can be used to find the nearest neighbors to new points. This is done via the search method:search(graph, queries, n_neighbors, queue_size) -> indices, distancesgraph: An instance of DescentGraph\nqueries: A vector of new data points of type Vector{V} or AbstractMatrix. Note that the dimensionality of the queries should match that of the data used to  originally construct the graph.n_neighbors: The number of neighbors to find for each query. This doesnot have to be the same as the number used to construct graph.queue_size: Each query maintains a heap of candidate neighbors.queue_size controls the maximum number of candidates as a multiple of n_neighbors. Default is 1..Similar to DescentGraph, this returns two matrices for the indices and distances to the nearest neighbors of each query.Example:queries = [rand(10) for _ in 1:100]\n# OR queries = rand(10, 100)\nidxs, dists = search(knngraph, queries, 4)"
