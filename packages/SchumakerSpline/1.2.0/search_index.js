    "text": "A simple shape preserving spline implementation in Julia.A Julia package to create a shape preserving spline. This is a shape preserving spline which is guaranteed to be monotonic and concave/convex if the data is monotonic and concave/convex. It does not use any numerical optimisation and is therefore quick and smoothly converges to a fixed point in economic dynamics problems including value function iteration. Analytical derivatives and integrals of the spline can easily be taken through the evaluate and evaluate_integral functions.This package has the same basic functionality as the R package called schumaker.If you want to do algebraic operations on splines you can also use a schumaker spline through the UnivariateFunctions package."

The slope of the line is given by the derivative at the start of the first interval and end of the last interval.\nConstant - This is where the first and last y values are used for prediction before the first point of the interval and after the last part of the interval respectively.pages = [\"index.md\",\n         \"examples.md\"]\nDepth = 2"
