    "text": "Plots is a plotting API and toolset.  My goals with the package are:Powerful.  Do more with less.  Complex visualizations become easy.\nIntuitive.  Stop reading so much documentation.  Commands should \"just work\".\nConcise.  Less code means fewer mistakes and more efficient development/analysis.\nFlexible.  Produce your favorite plots from your favorite package, but quicker and simpler.\nConsistent.  Don\'t commit to one graphics package, use the same code everywhere.\nLightweight.  Very few dependencies.\nSmart. Attempts to figure out what you want it to do... not just what you tell it.View the full documentation."
