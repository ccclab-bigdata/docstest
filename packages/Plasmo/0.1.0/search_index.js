    "text": "Plasmo.jl (Platform for Scalable Modeling and Optimization) is modeling interface that facilitates solving optimization problems using a graph-based approach.  The package enables component style modeling by means of modularizing optimization models that can be constructed independently and connected using linking constraints.     The graph-based modeling approach facilitates decomposition techniques such as graph partitioning and community detection which enable the use of parallel solvers such as PIPS-NLP,DSP, or built-in Julia solvers for Benders and Lagrangean Decomposition. Plasmo.jl has been developed by the Scalable Systems Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison."
