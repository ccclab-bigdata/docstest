    "text": "DynamicalSystem\n\nThe central structure of DynamicalSystems.jl. All functions of the suite that can use known equations of motion expect an instance of this type.\n\nConstructing a DynamicalSystem\n\nDiscreteDynamicalSystem(eom, state, p [, jacobian [, J0]]; t0::Int = 0)\nContinuousDynamicalSystem(eom, state, p [, jacobian [, J0]]; t0 = 0.0)\n\nwith eom the equations of motion function (see below). p is a parameter container, which we highly suggest to use a mutable object like Array, LMArray or a dictionary. Pass nothing in the place of p if your system does not have parameters.\n\nt0, J0 allow you to choose the initial time and provide an initialized Jacobian matrix. See CDS_KWARGS for the default options used to evolve continuous systems (through OrdinaryDiffEq).\n\nEquations of motion\n\nThe are two \"versions\" for DynamicalSystem, depending on whether the equations of motion (eom) are in-place (iip) or out-of-place (oop). Here is how to define them:\n\noop : The eom must be in the form eom(x, p, t) -> SVector which means that given a state x::SVector and some parameter container p it returns an SVector (from the StaticArrays module) containing the next state.\niip : The eom must be in the form eom!(xnew, x, p, t) which means that given a state x::Vector and some parameter container p, it writes in-place the new state in xnew.\n\nt stands for time (integer for discrete systems). iip is suggested for big systems, whereas oop is suggested for small systems. The break-even point at around 100 dimensions, and for using functions that use the tangent space (like e.g. lyapunovs or gali), the break-even point is at around 10 dimensions.\n\nThe constructor deduces automatically whether eom is iip or oop. It is not possible however to deduce whether the system is continuous or discrete just from the equations of motion, hence the 2 constructors.\n\nJacobian\n\nThe optional argument jacobian for the constructors is a function and (if given) must also be of the same form as the eom, jacobian(x, p, n) -> SMatrix for the out-of-place version and jacobian!(xnew, x, p, n) for the in-place version.\n\nIf jacobian is not given, it is constructed automatically using the module ForwardDiff. It is heavily advised to provide a Jacobian function, as it gives multiple orders of magnitude speedup.\n\nInterface to DifferentialEquations.jl\n\nContinuous systems are solved using DifferentialEquations.jl. The following two interfaces are provided:\n\nContinuousDynamicalSystem(prob::ODEProblem [, jacobian [, J0]])\nODEProblem(continuous_dynamical_system, tspan, args...)\n\nwhere in the second case args stands for the standard extra arguments of ODEProblem: callback, mass_matrix.\n\nIf you want to use callbacks with tangent_integrator or parallel_integrator, then invoke them with extra arguments as shown in the Advanced Documentation.\n\nRelevant Functions\n\ntrajectory, set_parameter!.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
