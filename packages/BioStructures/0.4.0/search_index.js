    "text": "The BioStructures.jl package provides functionality to manipulate macromolecular structures, and in particular to read and write Protein Data Bank (PDB) and mmCIF files. It is designed to be used for standard structural analysis tasks, as well as acting as a platform on which others can build to create more specific tools.It compares favourably in terms of performance to other PDB parsers - see some benchmarks. The PDB and mmCIF parsers currently read in the whole PDB without explicit errors (with one exception). Help can be found on individual functions using ?function_name."

If you want to read an mmCIF file into a dictionary to query yourself (e.g. to access metadata fields), use MMCIFDict:julia> mmcif_dict = MMCIFDict(\"/path/to/cif/file.cif\")\nmmCIF dictionary with 716 fields\n\njulia> mmcif_dict[\"_entity_src_nat.common_name\"]\n\"great nettle\"A MMCIFDict can be accessed in similar ways to a standard dictionary, and if necessary the underlying dictionary of MMCIFDict d can be accessed with d.dict.Refer to Downloading PDB files and Reading PDB files sections for more options.The elements of struc can be accessed as follows:Command Returns Return type\nstruc[1] Model 1 Model\nstruc[1][\"A\"] Model 1, chain A Chain\nstruc[1][\'A\'] Shortcut to above if the chain ID is a single character Chain\nstruc[\"A\"] The lowest model (model 1), chain A Chain\nstruc[\"A\"][\"50\"] Model 1, chain A, residue 50 AbstractResidue\nstruc[\"A\"][50] Shortcut to above if it is not a hetero residue and the insertion code is blank AbstractResidue\nstruc[\"A\"][\"H_90\"] Model 1, chain A, hetero residue 90 AbstractResidue\nstruc[\"A\"][50][\"CA\"] Model 1, chain A, residue 50, atom name CA AbstractAtom\nstruc[\"A\"][15][\"CG\"][\'A\'] For disordered atoms, access a specific location AtomDisordered atoms are stored in a DisorderedAtom container but calls fall back to the default atom, so disorder can be ignored if you are not interested in it. Disordered residues (i.e. point mutations with different residue names) are stored in a DisorderedResidue container.The idea is that disorder will only bother you if you want it to. See the Biopython discussion for more.Properties can be retrieved as follows:Function Returns Return type\nserial Serial number of an atom Int\natomname Name of an atom String\naltlocid Alternative location ID of an atom Char\nx x coordinate of an atom Float64\ny y coordinate of an atom Float64\nz z coordinate of an atom Float64\ncoords coordinates of an atom Array{Float64,1}\noccupancy Occupancy of an atom (default is 1.0) Float64\ntempfactor Temperature factor of an atom (default is 0.0) Float64\nelement Element of an atom (default is \"  \") String\ncharge Charge of an atom (default is \"  \") String\nresidue Residue an atom belongs to Residue\nishetero true if the residue or atom is a hetero residue/atom Bool\nisdisorderedatom true if the atom is disordered Bool\npdbline PDB ATOM/HETATM record for an atom String\nresname Residue name of a residue or atom String\nresnumber Residue number of a residue or atom Int\ninscode Insertion code of a residue or atom Char\nresid Residue ID of an atom or residue (full=true includes chain) String\natomnames Atom names of the atoms in a residue, sorted by serial Array{String,1}\natoms Dictionary of atoms in a residue Dict{String, AbstractAtom}\nisdisorderedres true if the residue has multiple residue names Bool\ndisorderedres Access a particular residue name in a DisorderedResidue Residue\nchain Chain a residue or atom belongs to Chain\nchainid Chain ID of a chain, residue or atom String\nresids Sorted residue IDs in a chain Array{String,1}\nresidues Dictionary of residues in a chain Dict{String, AbstractResidue}\nmodel Model a chain, residue or atom belongs to Model\nmodelnumber Model number of a model, chain, residue or atom Int\nchainids Sorted chain IDs in a model or structure Array{String,1}\nchains Dictionary of chains in a model or structure Dict{String, Chain}\nstructure Structure a model, chain, residue or atom belongs to ProteinStructure\nstructurename Name of the structure an element belongs to String\nmodelnumbers Sorted model numbers in a structure Array{Int,1}\nmodels Dictionary of models in a structure Dict{Int, Model}The strip keyword argument determines whether surrounding whitespace is stripped for atomname, element, charge, resname and atomnames (default true).The coordinates of an atom can be set using x!, y!, z! and coords!."

If you want the first sub-element you can use first. For example first(struc[1]) gets the first chain in model 1.collect can be used to get arrays of sub-elements. collectatoms, collectresidues, collectchains and collectmodels return arrays of a particular type from a structural element or element array.Selectors are functions passed as additional arguments to these functions. Only elements that return true when passed to all the selector are retained. For example:Command Action Return type\ncollect(struc[\'A\'][50]) Collect the sub-elements of an element, e.g. atoms from a residue Array{AbstractAtom,1}\ncollectresidues(struc) Collect the residues of an element Array{AbstractResidue,1}\ncollectatoms(struc) Collect the atoms of an element Array{AbstractAtom,1}\ncollectatoms(struc, calphaselector) Collect the C-alpha atoms of an element Array{AbstractAtom,1}\ncollectatoms(struc, calphaselector, disorderselector) Collect the disordered C-alpha atoms of an element Array{AbstractAtom,1}The selectors available are:Function Acts on Selects for\nstandardselector AbstractAtom or AbstractResidue Atoms/residues arising from standard (ATOM) records\nheteroselector AbstractAtom or AbstractResidue Atoms/residues arising from hetero (HETATM) records\natomnameselector AbstractAtom Atoms with atom name in a given list\ncalphaselector AbstractAtom C-alpha atoms\ncbetaselector AbstractAtom C-beta atoms, or C-alpha atoms for glycine residues\nbackboneselector AbstractAtom Atoms in the protein backbone (CA, N and C)\nheavyatomselector AbstractAtom Non-hydrogen atoms\nhydrogenselector AbstractAtom Hydrogen atoms\nresnameselector AbstractAtom or AbstractResidue Atoms/residues with residue name in a given list\nwaterselector AbstractAtom or AbstractResidue Atoms/residues with residue name HOH\nnotwaterselector AbstractAtom or AbstractResidue Atoms/residues with residue name not HOH\ndisorderselector AbstractAtom or AbstractResidue Atoms/residues with alternative locationsIt is easy to define your own atom, residue, chain or model selectors. The below will collect all atoms with x coordinate less than 0:xselector(at::AbstractAtom) = x(at) < 0\ncollectatoms(struc, xselector)Alternatively, you can use an anonymous function:collectatoms(struc, at -> x(at) < 0)countatoms, countresidues, countchains and countmodels can be used to count elements wth the same selector API. For example:julia> countatoms(struc)\n754\n\njulia> countatoms(struc, calphaselector)\n85\n\njulia> countresidues(struc, standardselector)\n85The sequence of a protein can be retrieved by passing a Chain or array of residues to AminoAcidSequence:julia> AminoAcidSequence(struc[\'A\'], standardselector)\n85aa Amino Acid Sequence:\nRCGSQGGGSTCPGLRCCSIWGWCGDSEPYCGRTCENKCWSGERSDHRCGAAVGNPPCGQDRCCSVHGWCGGGNDYCSGGNCQYRCSee BioSequences.jl for more on how to deal with sequences."

ContactMap can also be given two structural elements as arguments, in which case a non-symmetrical 2D array is returned showing contacts between the elements. The underlying BitArray{2} for ContactMap contacts can be accessed with contacts.data if required.julia> contacts = ContactMap(collectatoms(struc[\'A\'], cbetaselector), 8.0)\nContact map of size (85, 85)A plot recipe is defined for this so it can shown with Plots.jl:using Plots\nplot(contacts)(Image: contactmap)For a quick, text-based representation of a ContactMap use showcontactmap.DistanceMap works in an analogous way to ContactMap and gives a map of the distances. It can also be plotted:dists = DistanceMap(collectatoms(struc[\'A\'], cbetaselector))\nusing Plots\nplot(dists)(Image: distancemap)"
