    "text": "The package provides the CategoricalArray type designed to hold categorical data (either unordered/nominal or ordered/ordinal) efficiently and conveniently. CategoricalArray{T} holds values of type T. The CategoricalArray{Union{T, Missing}} variant can also contain missing values (represented as missing, of the Missing type). When indexed, CategoricalArray{T} returns special \"categorical value\" objects (CategoricalString for T = String or CategoricalValue{T} for any other T) rather than the original values of type T. CategoricalString and CategoricalValue are simple wrappers around the categorical levels; these types allow very efficient retrieval and comparison of actual values. See the PooledArrays.jl and IndirectArrays.jl packages for simpler array types storing data with a small number of values without wrapping them.The main feature of CategoricalArray is that it maintains a pool of the levels which can appear in the data. These levels are stored in a specific order: for unordered arrays, this order is only used for pretty printing (e.g. in cross tables or plots); for ordered arrays, it also allows comparing values using the < and > operators: the comparison is then based on the ordering of levels stored in the array. An ordered CategoricalValue can be also compared with a value that when converted is equal to one of the levels of this CategoricalValue. Whether an array is ordered can be defined either on construction via the ordered argument, or at any time via the ordered! function. The levels function returns all the levels of CategoricalArray, and the levels! function can be used to set the levels and their order. Levels are also automatically extended when setting an array element to a level not encountered before. But they are never removed without manual intervention: use the droplevels! function for this.CategoricalArray{T} is designed to work with any underlying type T, but the most common use case is T = String. To streamline operations with string categories, they are handled by the dedicated CategoricalString type. It supports all the operations of the generic CategoricalValue{T} plus all the operations which work on strings, and is actually a special type of string (i.e. CategoricalString <: AbstractString). The only difference from a standard String is that comparisons like < and > are based on the ordering of levels rather than on the lexicographic ordering (this also applies if CategoricalString is compared with AbstractString other than CategoricalString)."

    "text": "Suppose that you have data about four individuals, with three different age groups. Since this variable is clearly ordinal, we mark the array as such via the ordered argument.julia> using CategoricalArrays\n\njulia> x = CategoricalArray([\"Old\", \"Young\", \"Middle\", \"Young\"], ordered=true)\n4-element CategoricalArray{String,1,UInt32}:\n \"Old\"   \n \"Young\" \n \"Middle\"\n \"Young\" \nBy default, the levels are lexically sorted, which is clearly not correct in our case and would give incorrect results when testing for order. This is easily fixed using the levels! function to reorder levels:julia> levels(x)\n3-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Middle\"\n \"Old\"   \n \"Young\" \n\njulia> levels!(x, [\"Young\", \"Middle\", \"Old\"])\n4-element CategoricalArray{String,1,UInt32}:\n \"Old\"   \n \"Young\" \n \"Middle\"\n \"Young\" \nThanks to this order, we can not only test for equality between two values, but also compare the ages of e.g. individuals 1 and 2:julia> x[1]\nCategoricalString{UInt32} \"Old\" (3/3)\n\njulia> x[2]\nCategoricalString{UInt32} \"Young\" (1/3)\n\njulia> x[2] == x[4]\ntrue\n\njulia> x[1] > x[2]\ntrue\nNow let us imagine the first individual is actually in the \"Young\" group. Let\'s fix this (notice how the string \"Young\" is automatically converted to a CategoricalString):julia> x[1] = \"Young\"\n\"Young\"\n\njulia> x[1]\nCategoricalString{UInt32} \"Young\" (1/3)\nThe CategoricalArray still considers \"Old\" as a possible level even if it is unused now. This is necessary to allow efficiently accessing the levels and setting values of elements in the array: indeed, dropping unused levels requires iterating over every element in the array, which is expensive. This property can also be useful to keep track of possible levels, even if they do not occur in practice.To get rid of the \"Old\" group, just call the droplevels! function:julia> levels(x)\n3-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Young\" \n \"Middle\"\n \"Old\"   \n\njulia> droplevels!(x)\n4-element CategoricalArray{String,1,UInt32}:\n \"Young\" \n \"Young\" \n \"Middle\"\n \"Young\" \n\njulia> levels(x)\n2-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Young\" \n \"Middle\"\nAnother solution would have been to call levels!(x, [\"Young\", \"Middle\"]) manually. This command is safe too, since it will raise an error when trying to remove levels that are currently used:julia> levels!(x, [\"Young\", \"Midle\"])\nERROR: ArgumentError: cannot remove level \"Middle\" as it is used at position 3. Change the array element type to Union{String, Missing} using convert if you want to transform some levels to missing values.\n[...]\nNote that entries in the x array can be treated as strings (that\'s because CategoricalString <: AbstractString):julia> lowercase(x[3])\n\"middle\"\n\njulia> replace(x[3], \'M\'=>\'R\')\n\"Riddle\"droplevels!\nlevels\nlevels!"

    "text": "The examples above assumed that the data contained no missing values. This is generally not the case for real data. This is where CategoricalArray{Union{T, Missing}} comes into play. It is essentially the categorical-data equivalent of Array{Union{T, Missing}}. It behaves exactly as CategoricalArray{T}, except that when indexed it returns either a categorical value object (CategoricalString or CategoricalValue{T}) or missing if the value is missing. See the Julia manual for more information on the Missing type.Let\'s adapt the example developed above to support missing values. Since there are no missing values in the input vector, we need to specify that the array should be able to hold either a String or missing:julia> y = CategoricalArray{Union{Missing, String}}([\"Old\", \"Young\", \"Middle\", \"Young\"], ordered=true)\n4-element CategoricalArray{Union{Missing, String},1,UInt32}:\n \"Old\"   \n \"Young\" \n \"Middle\"\n \"Young\" \nLevels still need to be reordered manually:julia> levels(y)\n3-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Middle\"\n \"Old\"   \n \"Young\" \n\njulia> levels!(y, [\"Young\", \"Middle\", \"Old\"])\n4-element CategoricalArray{Union{Missing, String},1,UInt32}:\n \"Old\"   \n \"Young\" \n \"Middle\"\n \"Young\" \nAt this point, indexing into the array gives exactly the same resultjulia> y[1]\nCategoricalString{UInt32} \"Old\" (3/3)Missing values can be introduced either manually, or by restricting the set of possible levels. Let us imagine this time that we actually do not know the age of the first individual. We can set it to a missing value this way:julia> y[1] = missing\nmissing\n\njulia> y\n4-element CategoricalArray{Union{Missing, String},1,UInt32}:\n missing\n \"Young\" \n \"Middle\"\n \"Young\" \n\njulia> y[1]\nmissing\nIt is also possible to transform all values belonging to some levels into missing values, which gives the same result as above in the present case since we have only one individual in the \"Old\" group. Let\'s first restore the original value for the first element, and then set it to missing again using the allow_missing argument to levels!:julia> y[1] = \"Old\"\n\"Old\"\n\njulia> y\n4-element CategoricalArray{Union{Missing, String},1,UInt32}:\n \"Old\"   \n \"Young\" \n \"Middle\"\n \"Young\" \n\njulia> levels!(y, [\"Young\", \"Middle\"]; allow_missing=true)\n4-element CategoricalArray{Union{Missing, String},1,UInt32}:\n missing\n \"Young\" \n \"Middle\"\n \"Young\" \n"

    "text": "CategoricalArray is made of the two fields:refs: an integer array that stores the position of the category level in the index field of CategoricalPool for each CategoricalArray element; 0 denotes a missing value (for CategoricalArray{Union{T, Missing}} only).\npool: the CategoricalPool object that maintains the levels of the array.warning: Warning\nInteger codes in the x.refs field cannot be used to index into the vector returned by levels(x). These codes refer to the position in the index, which can be accessed using CategoricalArrays.index(x.pool). That is, CategoricalArrays.index(x.pool)[x.refs] == x always holds, but levels(x.pool)[x.refs] == x is not correct in general. To obtain the position in levels(x) of entries in x, use CategoricalArrays.order(x.pool)[x.refs].The reason for this subtlety is that it allows changing the order of levels without having to reset all the underlying integer codes. This is especially useful for the CategoricalArray(::AbstractArray) constructor, which needs to assign new codes as new levels are encountered, potentially conflicting with the default ordering of levels (based on sort).The CategoricalPool{V,R,C} type keeps track of the levels of type V and associates them with an integer reference code of type R (for internal use). It offers methods to set the levels, change their order while preserving the references, and efficiently get the integer index corresponding to a level and vice-versa. Whether the values of CategoricalArray are ordered or not is defined by an ordered field of the pool. Finally, CategoricalPool keeps a valindex vector of value objects of type C (CategoricalString{R} or CategoricalValue{V, R}), so that getindex can return the existing object instead of allocating a new one.The type parameters of CategoricalArray{T, N, R <: Integer, V, C, U} are a bit complex:T is the type of array elements without CategoricalString/CategoricalValue wrappers; if T >: Missing, then the array supports missing values.\nN is the number of array dimensions.\nR is the reference type, the element type of the refs field; it allows optimizing memory usage depending on the number of levels (i.e. CategoricalArray with less than 256 levels can use R = UInt8).\nV is the type of the levels, it is equal to T for arrays which do not support missing values; for arrays which support missing values, T = Union{V, Missing}\nC is the type of categorical values, i.e. the objects returned when indexing non-missing elements of CategoricalArray. C is CategoricalString{R} if V = String and CategoricalValue{V, R} for any other V.\nU can be either Union{} for arrays which do not support missing values, or Missing for those which support them.Only T, N and R could be specified upon construction. The last three parameters are chosen automatically, but are needed for the definition of the type. In particular, U allows expressing that CategoricalArray{T, N} inherits from AbstractArray{Union{C, U}, N} (which is equivalent to AbstractArray{C, N} for arrays which do not support missing values, and to AbstractArray{Union{C, Missing}, N} for those which support them).The CategoricalPool type is designed to limit the need to go over all elements of the vector, either for reading or for writing. This is why unused levels are not dropped automatically (this would force checking all elements on every modification or keeping a counts table), but only when droplevels! is called. levels is a (very fast) O(1) operation since it merely returns the (ordered) vector of levels without accessing the data at all.Another useful feature is that integer indices referring to levels are preserved when adding or reordering levels: the order of levels exposed to the user by the levels function does not necessarily match these internal indices, which are stored in the index field of the pool. This means a reordering of the levels is also an O(1) operation. On the other hand, deleting levels may change the indices and therefore requires iterating over all elements in the array to update the references."
