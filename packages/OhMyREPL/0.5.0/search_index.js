This will mean that there is no need to edit your .juliarc file and the Julia REPL will start a bit quicker since it does not have to parse and compile the package when it is loaded. The way to do this is described in the Julia manual but is also summarized here:Create a userimg.jl file that contains Base.require(:OhMyREPL).\nRun include(joinpath(JULIA_HOME, Base.DATAROOTDIR, \"julia\", \"build_sysimg.jl\"))\nRun build_sysimg(default_sysimg_path(), \"native\", USERIMGPATH; force=true) where USERIMGPATH is the path to the userimg.jl file.If you are building Julia from source, the userimg.jl file can just be moved to the Base folder and then run make like normal.Note that you will have to redo this process if OhMyREPL is updated."
