**`GeoEfficiency`** &mdash; *Module*.



**GeoEfficiency Package**

GeoEfficiency Package represent a fast and flexible tool to calculate in batch or individually the geometrical efficiency for a set of common radiation detectors shapes (cylindrical, Bore-hole, Well-type) as seen form a source. the source can be a point, a disc or even a cylinder.

**Quick Usage**

  * geoEff()	: Calculate the geometrical efficiency for one geometrical setup return only the value of the geometrical efficiency.

  * calc() 	: Calculate the geometrical efficiency for one geometrical setup and display full information on the console.

  * calcN()	: Calculate the geometrical efficiency for geometrical setup(s) and display full information on the console until the user quit.

  * batch()	: Calculate the geometrical efficiency using data in the "GeoEfficiency" folder in batch mode.
