ℤ[x,y]For entering ℤ, type \\bbZ<tab> in the Julia command line. (Juno and julia-vim support this as well.) We support ℤ (arbitrary precision integers), ℚ (fractions of arbitrary precision integers), ℝ (arbitrary precision floating point) and ℂ (a + im*b with both coefficients in ℝ).If your variables have numbers instead of distinct names, you can use [] to represent that:R = @ring! ℤ[c[]]This will make available the object c, which you can use as follows:c1,c2,c3 = c[1], c[2], c[3]; c1,c2,c3  # or\nc1,c2,c3 = c[1:3]; c1,c2,c3            # or\nc1,c2,c3 = c[]; c1,c2,c3               # or\n# note that the following keeps state:\nc1 = c(); c2 = c(); c3 = c(); c1,c2,c3\nc4 = c(); c5 = c(); c6 = c(); c4,c5,c6Note that you cannot combine named and numbered variables in one ring definition. However, you can let one kind of ring be the base ring for another:R = @ring!

    "text": "It is common to use names such as f,g,h for polynomials and names such as xyz for the variables in your ring. For example, you might defineR = @ring! ℤ[x,y,z]\nf = x^2 - x*yIn this situation, f is a variable in your script, of type R.You might also defineg(x,y) = x^2 - x*ybut this means something different.  In this case, x and y are arguments to the function, and in its body, they take whatever value you pass to g. For example:g(x,y)\ng(y,x)\ng(y,y)Maybe by now you wonder about x and y: are they Julia variables or just names? The answer is easiest to understand if we look at the @ring macro. Note that this one does not have the ! in the end:using PolynomialRings\nS = @ring ℤ[x,y]\nxAs you can see, we did define a type S that contains polynomials with names x and y for the variables. However, in our script, the variable x doesn\'t exist. The way to get the variable with name x is to start with the symbol :x, and convert it to S. Here\'s how:S(:x)The result is an object of type S, much like how f was an object of type R. It represents a polynomial with just one term: 1x.Wouldn\'t it be practical if we would do x = S(:x) and y = S(:y) now? That way, we can use the Julia variable x to refer to the polynomial x. Indeed, that\'s exactly what @ring! (with !) does!In the next chapters, we will often pass variables as arguments. For example, we pass the variable in which we are doing an expansion, or the variable with respect to which we are taking a derivative. In those cases, we pass the variable as a symbol (e.g. :x) to the function. For example, this works:diff(x^3, :x)But this doesn\'t:diff(x^3, x)In some cases, we offer a convenience macro. For example, the @deg macro:deg(x^3*y^4, :x)\ndeg(x^3*y^4, :y)\n@deg x^3*y^4 y"

Set{R} and Dict{R} should work, since type conversion will happen before hashing.For seeing the constituent parts of a polynomial, use the @expand macro.

ℤ[x,y]\nI = [x^5, x^2 + y, x*y + y^2]\nrem(y^2, I)  # nonzero, even though y^2 ∈ (I)However, if you compute a Gröbner basis first, you will:G = gröbner_basis(I)\nrem(y^2, G) # now, it reduces to zero.If you want to obtain the expression of y^2 in these elements, you can first use div to obtain the (row) vector of factors expressing y^2 in G:div(y^2, G)The gröbner_transformation function gives a matrix tr expressing G in terms of I:G, tr = gröbner_transformation(I); tr\ndiv(y^2, G) * tr * I   # gives back y^2In other words, by looking atdiv(y^2, G) * trwe see that y^2 = 1(x^5) + (y + xy - x^3)(x^2 + y) + -x(xy + y^2) which proves that y^2 in (I)."

Imagine that you want to write a function that computes a derivative in the following way:function myderivative(f::RR, varsymbol) where RR <: Polynomial\n    varvalue = RR(varsymbol)\n    @ring! Int[ε]\n    return @coefficient f(; varsymbol => varvalue + ε) ε^1\nend\nmyderivative(x^3 + x^2, :x)(In fact, diff is already built-in and has a more efficient implementation, but this example is for educational purposes.)This works, but what about the following?@ring! ℚ[ε]\nmyderivative(ε^3 + ε^2, :ε)This gives a wrong answer because of the naming clash inside myderivative. You may be tempted to work around this as follows:function myderivative2(f::RR, varsymbol) where RR <: Polynomial\n    varvalue = RR(varsymbol)\n    ε = gensym()\n    _,(ε_val,) = polynomial_ring(ε)\n    return coefficient(f(;varsymbol => varvalue + ε_val), (1,), ε)\nend\nmyderivative2(ε^3 + ε^2, :ε)which gives the correct answer. Unfortunately, this is very inefficient:@time myderivative2(ε^3 + ε^2, :ε);\n@time myderivative2(ε^3 + ε^2, :ε);The reason is that variable names are part of the type definition, and Julia specializes functions based on the type of its arguments. In this case, that means that for evaluating the @coefficient call, and for the substitution call, all the code needs to be compiled every time you call myderivative.For this reason, we provide a function formal_coefficient(R) which yields a variable that\'s guaranteed not to clash with the ring that you pass as an argument:function myderivative3(f::RR, varsymbol) where RR <: Polynomial\n    varvalue = RR(varsymbol)\n    ε_sym, ε_val = formal_coefficient(typeof(f))\n    return coefficient(f(;varsymbol => varvalue + ε_val), (1,), ε_sym)\nend\n@time myderivative3(ε^3 + ε^2, :ε);   # first time is still slow (compiling)\n@time myderivative3(ε^3 + ε^2, :ε);   # but much faster the second time\n@time myderivative3(ε^3 + ε^2, :ε);   # and the third"

We offer a convenience function base_extend to extend to ℚ:rem(base_extend(2x^2), base_extend(3x + 1))If you want, you can also extend to bigger base rings than the quotient field by passing that as an extra parameter. For example:f = base_extend(x^2 + 1, Complex{Rational{Int}})\ndiv(f, [x - im])By the way, if you are looking for an operation like rem that stays in the integers, have a look at xrem and friends. For example:xdiv(2x^2, 3x + 1)\nxrem(2x^2, 3x + 1)This output signifies that -9 times the first argument is equal to -6x + 2 times the second argument plus -2.

In terms of implementation, the first version uses a Tuple to represent the exponents, whereas the second version uses a SparseVector. This means that for moderate number of variables, the former is often more efficient than the latter as tuples can often remain on the stack, saving allocation and garbage collection overhead. This stops being true when your exponents are very sparse, when the overhead of dealing with all the zeros in the tuple is worse than the overhead of garbage collection.If you want to transform a set of polynomials from the latter representation to the former, use to_dense_monomials. This is sometimes beneficial right before doing a computationally expensive operation, e.g. a Gröbner basis computation."

Or to regard a polynomial in five variables with coefficients in ℚ as a two-variable polynomial with coefficients in the ring of three-variable polynomials over ℚ.This makes the signature of some functions a bit different than usual. For example, a function call like    coefficient(x^3 + x^2*y + y, y)is ambiguous: should the result be 1 or x^2+1? Most other computer algebra systems base their decision on the parent object for the polynomial: these two results are what one gets if it is, respectively, ℚ[x,y] or ℚ[x][y].We make a different choice: the variables relative to which one wants to take the expansion, need to be passed explicitly:julia> coefficient(x^3 + x^2*y + y, (1,), :y)\nx^2 + 1\njulia> coefficient(x^3 + x^2*y + y, (0,1), :x, :y)\n1At first glance, this may seem more cumbersome than usual. However, in a situation where one switches perspective regularly, the alternative is much harder to work with. This is because it is not obvious from the name of a variable x which parent object it belongs to.Moreover, in practice, this choice does not sacrifice convenience at all, because the following macro is provided:julia> @coefficient(x^2 + x^2*y + y, y)\nx^2 + 1\njulia> @coefficient(x^2 + x^2*y + y, x^0 * y)\n1We (intend to) have similar \'relative\' versions of functions such as expansion(), leading_term() and deg()."

What place does PolynomialRings take?The most important design difference is that in the latter, we choose to make variable names (for example x and y) part of the type specification, as opposed to part of the data structure.  We feel this is necessary for type stability. For example, the expression (x+y)*x has exponents of type Tuple{Int,Int}, whereas the expression (x+y)*z has exponents of type Tuple{Int,Int,Int}. This is true even though in both cases, the arguments to * have exponents of type Tuple{Int,Int} and Tuple{Int} respectively. This means that the return type can only be inferred if the variable names are part of the type.In doing so, this is a nice exercise for Julia\'s type system.

As a speculative example, consider the following. In Julia, an invocation such as@coefficient(f*g, x^10*y^10)could conceivably notice that the first argument is a product.
