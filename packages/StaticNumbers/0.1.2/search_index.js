    "text": "(Image: Build Status) (Image: codecov.io)This package provides Number datatypes which store their data in a type parameter. These are referred to as StaticNumbers. (The word \"static\" has lots of uses in computer science. Here, it means that the number is constant at runtime.)Data that is passed in type parameters is (usually) handled at compile-time, rather than at run-time. In certain cases this can lead to better performance. For this reason, some functions accept \"value type\" arguments, Val{X}(), where X is an argument that is passed at compile-time. [manual/performance-tips.html#Types-with-values-as-parameters-1] [manual/types.html#\"Value-types\"-1] Static is an alternative to Val which is specifically designed to handle numbers.The difference between Val and Static is that Static types promote and convert like their type parameters, so they can be used directly in arithmetic operations. (For example static(1) + 1 equals 2.) This makes it possible to use them with functions that were not specifically written to accept value arguments.Under the surface, there are three Static datatypes: StaticInteger, StaticReal, and StaticNumber, subtypes of Integer, Real and Number respectively. The Union type Static can be used to refer to them all. For brevity, all three types are displayed as static(X), and it is also recommended to create them using this syntax.Note: At the moment, the type union is names Static, while the function that creates static variables is named static.By default, any operation on a Static will result in a non-Static type. For example, static(2)+static(2) gives 4, not static(4). But Julia\'s type inference engine is quite powerful! If a and b are Static, then the type of static(a+b) will be inferred.It is of course also possible to overload methods to return Static for Static inputs. The @staticnumbers macro can be used on a small set of Static numbers to make certain operations preserve the Static type when possible.When creating Static numbers, it is important to consider whether the type system will be able to work efficiently. For example, f(static(x), y) is likely slower than f(x, y) even when called repeatedly with the same x. A specialized method of f is created for this value of x, and the function call itself will be faster. But since the type system will not know the type of static(x) in advance, a dynamic dispatch will happen at each function call.On the other hand, something like f(x==0 ? static(0) : x, y) will typically be fast. The construct x==0 ? static(0) : x will belong to Union{typeof(x), static(0)}, and Julia is able to dispatch efficiently on small type unions. A shorthand for this construct is f(x â©¢ 0, y).It is important not to make the set of Static numbers too large, as this can lead to a lot of compilation overhead. See: [manual/performance-tips.html#The-dangers-of-abusing-multiple-dispatch-(aka,-more-on-types-with-values-as-parameters)-1]There is no StaticRational datatype, but a StaticReal with a Rational type parameter will convert and promote like its parameter. For example: static(1//2) + 1 === 3//2.Static numbers are only fast when fully specified. A Vector{Static} is much slower than a Vector{Int}. (A Vector{StaticInteger{1}} is fast and requires very little memory, but on the other hand it can only store the number one.)"

For example, if the common 1:n range is multiplied by a scalar, the zeroth element can remain StaticInteger{0}\n\nThe step is the distance between successive elements of the range.\n\nThe length must be an Integer. A LengthRange is parameterized by its length, rather than its last element.
