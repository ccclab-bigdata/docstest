    "text": "(Image: Build Status) (Image: Coverage Status) (Image: codecov.io)This repository is a set of extension functionality for estimating the parameters of differential equations using Bayesian methods. It allows the choice of using Stan.jl, Turing.jl, DynamicHMC.jl and ApproxBayes.jl to perform a Bayesian estimation of a differential equation problem specified via the DifferentialEquations.jl interface.To begin you first need to add this repository using the following command.Pkg.add(\"DiffEqBayes\")\nusing DiffEqBayes"

The Stan installation process is required to use this function. The input requires that the function is defined by a ParameterizedFunction with the @ode_def macro. t is the array of time and data is the array where the first dimension (columns) corresponds to the array of system values. priors is an array of prior distributions for each parameter, specified via a Distributions.jl type. alg is a choice between :rk45 and :bdf, the two internal integrators of Stan. num_samples is the number of samples to take per chain, and num_warmup is the number of MCMC warmup steps. abstol and reltol are the keyword arguments for the internal integrator. liklihood is the likelihood distribution to use with the arguments from vars, and vars is a tuple of priors for the distributions of the likelihood hyperparameters. The special value StanODEData() in this tuple denotes the position that the ODE solution takes in the likelihood\'s parameter list."
