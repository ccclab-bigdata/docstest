The typical choices are listed below:Method When to use it\nConjugate Gradients Best choice for symmetric, positive-definite matrices\nMINRES For symmetric, indefinite matrices\nGMRES For nonsymmetric matrices when a good preconditioner is available\nIDR(s) For nonsymmetric, strongly indefinite problems without a good preconditioner\nBiCGStab(l) Otherwise for nonsymmetric problemsWe also offer Chebyshev iteration as an alternative to Conjugate Gradients when bounds on the spectrum are known.Stationary methods like Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, SOR and SSOR can be used as smoothers to reduce high-frequency components in the error in just a few iterations.When solving least-squares problems we currently offer just LSMR and LSQR."

    "text": "The implementation pre-allocates a matrix V of size n by restart whose columns form an orthonormal basis for the Krylov subspace. This allows BLAS2 operations when updating the solution vector x. The Hessenberg matrix is also pre-allocated.Modified Gram-Schmidt is used to orthogonalize the columns of V.The computation of the residual norm is implemented in a non-standard way, namely keeping track of a vector gamma in the null-space of H_k^*, which is the adjoint of the (k + 1) times k Hessenberg matrix H_k at the kth iteration. Only when x needs to be updated is the Hessenberg matrix mutated with Givens rotations.tip: Tip\nGMRES can be used as an iterator. This makes it possible to access the Hessenberg matrix and Krylov basis vectors during the iterations."

The implementations of stationary methods have this goal in mind, which means there is no other stopping criterion besides the maximum number of iterations.note: CSC versus CSR\nJulia stores matrices column-major. In order to avoid cache misses, the implementations of our stationary methods traverse the matrices column-major. This deviates from classical textbook implementations. Also the SOR and SSOR methods cannot be computed efficiently in-place, but require a temporary vector.When it comes to SparseMatrixCSC, we precompute in all stationary methods an integer array of the indices of the diagonal to avoid expensive searches in each iteration."

Thick restarting can be turned off by setting k = maxiter, but most of the time this is not desirable.The singular vectors are computed directly by forming the Ritz vectors from the product of the Lanczos vectors L.P/L.Q and the singular vectors of L.B. Additional accuracy in the singular triples can be obtained using inverse iteration.[Hernandez2008]: Vicente Hernández, José E.
