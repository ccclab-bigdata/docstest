    "text": "This packages provides Julia arrays with named dimensions.  Like the built-in Array type these are mutable objects,  unlike NamedArrays and AxisArrays which are immutable. The idea was to have a convenient way to gather results of calculations in a script or notebook, rather than for anything high-performance.  For example, here I have a matrix of results at each iteration, and nest these into a 3-tensor, whose axis order I need not remember:using DimArrays\n\nlist = [];\nfor i=1:33\n    slowcalc = sqrt(i) .* randn(3,13) .+ i\n    push!(list, DimArray(slowcalc, :a, :b, :c ))  # add labels for 1st and 2nd dimensions  \nend\n\nlist3 = nest(list, :iter)   # now i is the 3rd index, and named \"iter\"\n\nusing Statistics\n\nmean(list3, dims=:iter)     # equivalent to dropdims(mean(list3, dims=3), dims=3)For quick plots, dimension names are used for axes and series: using Plots\n\nplot(selectdim(list3, :b, 1)\' , legend=:bottomright)Here selectdim(list3, :b, 1) == list3[:,1,:] in contents, but retains the labels.Besides each dimension\'s name (which is a Symbol, strings will be converted) it can also store a function, which is used in plotting to scale the axes etc.  (But only the output, getindex uses original integer indices). You can pass a number by which to scale the index, or a dictionary, instead of a function.For example, this plots data saved every 4 iterations correctly over the above example:saveevery = 4\nlist4 = DimArray([], :iter, saveevery);     # equivalent to function  i->4i\nfor i=1:33\n    slowcalc = sqrt(i) .* randn(3,23) .+ i\n    slownice = DimArray(slowcalc, [:a, :b], [Dict(1=>\"one\", 2=>\"two\", 3=>\"three\")], :stuff )\n                                            # equivalent to  i->Dict(...)[i]\n    rem(i,saveevery)==0 && push!(list4, slownice)\nend\nnest(list4)\n\nplot!(mean(nest(list4), dims=:b)\', s=:dash)If you do not provide a name for a dimension (or give an empty string \"\")  then you can still refer to it by default names like size(x, :row) == size(x,1) or maximum(y, :col) etc.  However these defaults are not stored, and not manipulated by transpose(x) or kron(x,y).For now, the list of functions supported is:DimArray, DimVector, DimMatrix create one, taking names and functions for dimensions in the order given.\ndictvector defines a DimVector whose function is a Dict. \nnest converts arrays of arrays, and squeeze drops dimensions of size 1. and these built-in functions:selectdim, size understand a dimension\'s name.\nsum, maximum, minimum, dropdims and Statistics.mean, std: all can be called with a dimension\'s name, in which case by default squeeze=true on that dimension, like mean(..., dims=:b) above.   They can also be called with a list of dimensions: sum(x, dims=[1,:c]) etc.\npush!, append!, hcat, vcat, transpose, ctranspose, permutedims.\nMatrix multiplication * will warn (once) if you multiply along directions with mismatched names... which may be a terrible idea.   And kronecker products produce new names like :a_b.  \ncollect, implicitly used by comprehensions like [ sqrt(n) for n in DimVector(1:10, \"int\")\' ] which thus inherit the names of the array being iterated over.Since DimArray <: AbstractArray anything else will fall back on their methods, and forget the dimension labels. See also:NamedArrays\nAxisArrays\nRecursiveArrayTools\nJuliennedArraysToDo:Make things like x[:, 1:10:end] and hcat(a,b) update the functions correctly.\nFigure out Julia 0.7\'s new broadcasting machinery.Michael Abbott, January 2018, mostly (as I had a grant to write).(Image: Build Status)<!– (Image: Coverage Status) (Image: codecov.io) –> <!– Note to self: pandoc -o README.html README.md –>"
