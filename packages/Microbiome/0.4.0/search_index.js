    "text": "Tables of abundances are based off ComMatrix types from SpatialEcology.jl, where columns are samples and rows are features (eg species). Sample and feature names are also stored, and there\'s a convenience function if you want to convert a DataFrame to a ComMatrix, assuming the first column contains feature names:using Microbiome\nusing DataFrames\n\ndf = DataFrame(species=[\"E. coli\", \"B. fragilis\", \"L. casei\"],\n                      sample1=[1, 4, 5],\n                      sample2=[3, 8, 0],\n                      sample3=[0, 3, 4]);\n\nabund = abundancetable(df)Forgive the clutter... ComMatricies name rows as species (which is true in this case, but need not be), and columns are \"sites\" rather than samples. That will be fixed eventually.samplenames(abund)\nfeaturenames(abund)\nsampletotals(abund) # this is column sums\nfeaturetotals(abund) # this is row sumsIf you want relative abundance, you can do relativeabundance(abund) or relativeabundance!(abund):relativeabundance!(abund)\n\nsampletotals(abund)You can also filter on the n most abundant features accross the dataset. This function automatically generates an n+1 row for other containing the remaining features. Note - these doesn\'t modify in-place, so you\'ve gotta reassign if you want to update:abund2 = filterabund(abund, 1)\n\nfeaturenames(abund2)"

    "text": "Quite often, it\'s useful to boil stuff down to distances between samples. For this, I\'m using an interface with Distances.jl to generate a symetric DistanceMatrix, which also contains a vector for samples, and a field specifying which type of distance was used to calulate it. You can load one in manually, or generate it from an AbundanceTable.using Distances\nusing Microbiome\n\nabund = abundancetable([1  3  0;\n                        4  8  3;\n                        5  0  4]);\n\ndm = getdm(abund, BrayCurtis())I\'ve also implemented a method to do a principle coordinates analysis. If necessary, you can include correct_neg=true to use the correction method described in Lingoes (1971)p = pcoa(dm)\n\neigenvalue(p, 2)\nprincipalcoord(p, 1)\nvariance(p, [1,2])"

Work-in-progress PRs are fine, as discussion about approach and code review can happen in the PR.Before merging, any new code should be unit tested and have docs for newly exported functions, but if you don\'t know how to do this, don\'t worry, we can help!"
