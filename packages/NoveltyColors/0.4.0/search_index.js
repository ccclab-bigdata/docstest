Unlike Color.jl, there is not (necessarily) any theoretical underpinnings to these palettes. Color palettes provided within this package may represent Internet memes, generalized color palettes seen in advertising or on television/movies, or just aesthetically pleasing colors.If you are visualizing data for presentation or publication, you should validate that any of these color schemes provide acceptable contrast when printed in Black & White, are appropriate for colorblind individuals and any other considerations.The color palettes are stored and exported in a plain Julia Dict type, named ColorDict"
