    "text": "PiecewiseDeterministicMarkovProcesses.jl is a Julia package that allows simulation of Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMP); these encompass hybrid systems and jump processes, comprised of continuous and discrete components, as well as processes with time-varying rates. The aim of the package is to provide methods for the simulation of these processes that are \"exact\" up to the ODE integrator.We provide several methods for the simulation:a recent trick, called CHV, explained in paper-2015 which allows to implement the True Jump Method without the need to use event detection schemes for the ODE integrator. These event detections can be quite unstable as explained in paper-2015 and CHV provide a solution to this problem.\nrejection methods for which the user is asked to provide a bound on the reaction rates. These last methods are the most \"exact\" but not the fastest if the reaction rate bound is not tight. In case the flow is known analytically, a method is also provided.These methods require solving stiff ODEs (for CHV ) in an efficient manner. Sundials.jl and LSODA.jl are used, but other solvers could be easily added. (See stiff ode solvers).We briefly recall facts about a simple class of PDMPs. They are described by a couple (x_cx_d) where x_c is solution of the differential equation fracdx_cdt = F(x_cx_dt). The second component x_d is a jump process with rates R(x_cx_dt). At each jump of x_d, a jump can also be added to the continuous variable x_c."

    "text": "A strong requirement for the CHV method is that the total rate (i.e. sum(rate)) must be positive. This can be easily achieved by adding a dummy Poisson process with very low intensity (see next section).See also the examples directory for more involved examples. A simple example of jump process is given below. More precisely, we look at the following process of switching dynamics where X(t) = (x_c(t) x_d(t)) inmathbb Rtimeslbrace-11rbrace In between jumps, x_c evolves according to dot x_c(t) = x_d(t)x_c(t)  We first need to load the library.  using PiecewiseDeterministicMarkovProcessesWe then define a function that encodes the dynamics in between jumps. We need to provide the vector field of the ODE. Hence, we need to define a function that, given continuous state x_c and discrete state x_d at time t, returns the vector field. In addition some parameters can be passed with the variable parms.function F_tcp!(xcdot, xc, xd, t, parms)\n  # vector field used for the continuous variable\n  xcdot[1] = xd[1]*xc[1]\nend Let\'s consider a stochastic process with following transitions:Transition Rate Reaction number Jump\nx_dto x_d-2 if x_d0 1 1 [-2]\nx_dto x_d+2 if x_d0 1 2 [2]We implement these jumps using a 2x1 matrix nu of Integers, such that the jumps on each discrete component of xd is given by nu * xd. Hence, we have nu = reshape([[2];[-2]],2,1).	These reactions with their rate are encoded in the following function.function R_tcp!(rate, xc, xd, t, parms, sum_rate::Bool)\n  # transition rates function for each transition\n  # in this case,  the transitions are xd->xd+2 or xd->xd-2\n  # sum_rate is a boolean which tells R_tcp if it needs to return the total reaction rates, this may \n  # i.e. the sum of the rates or the vector of the rates\n  if sum_rate == false\n      if xd[1] > 0\n          rate[1] = 0.\n          rate[2] = 1.\n      else\n      	  rate[1] = 1.\n          rate[2] = 0.\n      end\n      #we return 0. because nothing is supposed to be returned\n      return 0.\n  else\n  	# we return sum(rate) without altering rate as we are asked to do\n    return 1.\n  end\nend\n\n# initial conditions for the continuous/discrete variables\nxc0 = vec([0.05])\nxd0 = vec([1])\n\n# matrix of jumps for the discrete variables, analogous to chemical reactions\nnu = reshape([[2];[-2]],2,1)\n\n\n# parameters\nparms = [0.]\ntf = 25.\n\n# compile the program:\ndummy =  PiecewiseDeterministicMarkovProcesses.pdmp!(xc0,xd0,F_tcp!,R_tcp!,nu,parms,0.0,tf,n_jumps=1)\n\n# compute a trajectory, in this case 100 jumps\nsrand(123)\nresult =  @time PiecewiseDeterministicMarkovProcesses.pdmp!(xc0,xd0,F_tcp!,R_tcp!,nu,parms,0.0,tf,n_jumps=100)\n\n# plotting\nusing Plots\nPlots.plot(result.time, result.xd[1,:],line=:step,title = string(\"#Jumps = \",length(result.time)),label=\"Xd\")\nPlots.plot(result.time, result.xc\',title = string(\"#Jumps = \",length(result.time)),label=\"Xc\")This produces the following graph:(Image: TCP)"

    "text": "The current interface \"only\" returns the jumping times. On may want to resolve the trajectory in between jumps. For example, in the previous example, in between two jumps, the trajectory should be exponential and not linear as shown.

The rejection method assumes some a priori knowledge of the process one wants to simulate. In particular, the user must be able to provide a bound on the total rate. More precisely, the user must provide a constant bound in between jump. To use this method, one needs to return sum(rate), bound_rejection in the above function R_tcp!.

    "text": "The choice of the method CHV vs Rejection only depends on how much you know about the system. More precisely, if the total rate function does not vary much in between jumps, use the rejection method. For example, if the rate is R(x_c(t)) = 1+01cos(t),  then 1+01 will provide a tight bound to use for the rejection method and almost no (fictitious) jumps will be rejected. In all other cases, one should try the CHV method where no a priori knowledge of the rate function is requied."
