    "text": "The DataStreams.jl package aims to define a generic and performant framework for the transfer of \"table-like\" data. (i.e. data that can, at least in some sense, be described by rows and columns).The framework achieves this by defining interfaces (i.e. a group of methods) for Data.Source types and methods to describe how they \"provide\" data; as well as Data.Sink types and methods around how they \"receive\" data. This allows Data.Sources and Data.Sinks to implement their interfaces separately, without needing to be aware of each other. The end result is an ecosystem of packages that \"automatically\" talk with each other, with adding an additional package not requiring changes to existing packages.Packages can have a single julia type implement both the Data.Source and Data.Sink interfaces, or two separate types can implement them separately.

Some sources can provide in-memory access to their data in the form of a Vector{UInt8}, i.e. a single byte vector, that sinks can \"point to\" when streaming, instead of needing to always copy all the data. In particular, the WeakRefStrings package provides utilities for creating \"string types\" that don\'t actually hold their own data, but instead just \"point\" to data that lives elsewhere. As Strings can be some of the most expensive data structures to copy and move around, this provides excellent performance gains in some cases when the sink is able to leverage this alternative structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "category": "type",
    "text": "Represents a type that can have data streamed to it from Data.Sources.\n\nTo satisfy the Data.Sink interface, it must provide two constructors with the following signatures:\n\n[Sink](sch::Data.Schema, S::Type{StreamType}, append::Bool, args...; reference::Vector{UInt8}=UInt8[], kwargs...) => [Sink]\n[Sink](sink, sch::Data.Schema, S::Type{StreamType}, append::Bool; reference::Vector{UInt8}=UInt8[]) => [Sink]\n\nLet\'s break these down, piece by piece:\n\n[Sink]: this is your sink type, i.e. CSV.Sink, DataFrame, etc. You\'re defining a constructor for your sink type.\nsch::Data.Schema: in the streaming process, the schema of a Data.Source is provided to the sink in order to allow the sink to \"initialize\" properly in order to receive data according to the format in sch. This might mean pre-allocating space according to the # of rows/columns in the source, managing the sink\'s own schema to match sch, etc.\nS::Type{StreamType}: S represents the type of streaming that will occur from the Data.Source, either Data.Field or Data.Column\nappend::Bool: a boolean flag indicating whether the data should be appended to a sink\'s existing data store, or, if false, if the sink\'s data should be fully replaced by the incoming Data.Source\'s data\nargs...: In the 1st constructor form, args... represents a catchall for any additional arguments your sink may need to construct. For example, SQLite.jl defines Sink(sch, S, append, db, table_name), meaning that the db and table_name are additional required arguments in order to properly create an SQLite.Sink.\nreference::Vector{UInt8}: if your sink defined Data.weakrefstrings(sink::MySink) = true, then it also needs to be able to accept the reference keyword argument, where a source\'s memory block will be passed, to be held onto appropriately by the sink when streaming WeakRefStrings. If a sink does not support streaming WeakRefStrings (the default), the sink constructor doesn\'t need to support any keyword arguments.\nkwargs...: Similar to args..., kwargs... is a catchall for any additional keyword arguments you\'d like to expose for your sink constructor, typically matching supported keyword arguments that are provided through the normal sink constructor\nsink: in the 2nd form, an already-constructed sink is passed in as the 1st argument. This allows efficient sink re-use. This constructor needs to ensure the existing sink is modified (enlarged, shrunk, schema changes, etc) to be ready to accept the incoming source data as described by sch.\n\nNow let\'s look at an example implementation from CSV.jl:\n\nfunction CSV.Sink(fullpath::AbstractString; append::Bool=false, headers::Bool=true, colnames::Vector{String}=String[], kwargs...)\n    io = IOBuffer()\n    options = CSV.Options(kwargs...)\n    !append && header && !isempty(colnames) && writeheaders(io, colnames, options)\n    return CSV.Sink(options, io, fullpath, position(io), !append && header && !isempty(colnames), colnames, length(colnames), append)\nend\n\nfunction CSV.Sink(sch::Data.Schema, T, append, file::AbstractString; reference::Vector{UInt8}=UInt8[], kwargs...)\n    sink = CSV.Sink(file; append=append, colnames=Data.header(sch), kwargs...)\n    return sink\nend\n\nfunction CSV.Sink(sink, sch::Data.Schema, T, append; reference::Vector{UInt8}=UInt8[])\n    sink.append = append\n    sink.cols = size(sch, 2)\n    !sink.header && !append && writeheaders(sink.io, Data.header(sch), sink.options, sink.quotefields)\n    return sink\nend\n\nIn this case, CSV.jl defined an initial constructor that just takes the filename with a few keyword arguments. The two required Data.Sink constructors are then defined. The first constructs a new Sink, requiring a file::AbstractString argument. We also see that CSV.Sink supports WeakRefString streaming by accepting a reference keyword argument (which is trivially implemented for CSV, since all data is simply written out to disk as text).\n\nFor the 2nd (last) constructor in the definitions above, we see the case where an existing sink is passed to CSV.Sink. The sink updates a few of its fields (sink.append = append), and some logic is computed to determine if the column headers should be written.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

For Data.Field streaming, the transform function should be of the form f(x::T) => y::S, i.e. takes a single input of type T and returns a single value of type S. For Data.Column streaming, it should be of the form f(x::AbstractVector{T}) => y::AbstractVector{S}, i.e. take an AbstractVector with eltype T and return another AbstractVector with eltype S.\n\nFor the 2nd definition, the Sink type itself is passed as the 2nd argument (::Type{Sink}) and is constructed \"on-the-fly\", being passed args... and kwargs... like Sink(args...; kwargs...).\n\nWhile users are free to call Data.stream! themselves, oftentimes, packages want to provide even higher-level convenience functions.\n\nAn example of of these higher-level convenience functions are from CSV.jl:\n\nfunction CSV.read(fullpath::Union{AbstractString,IO}, sink::Type=DataFrame, args...; append::Bool=false, transforms::Dict=Dict{Int,Function}(), kwargs...)\n    source = CSV.Source(fullpath; kwargs...)\n    sink = Data.stream!(source, sink, args...; append=append, transforms=transforms, kwargs...)\n    return Data.close!(sink)\nend\n\nfunction CSV.read(fullpath::Union{AbstractString,IO}, sink::T; append::Bool=false, transforms::Dict=Dict{Int,Function}(), kwargs...) where T\n    source = CSV.Source(fullpath; kwargs...)\n    sink = Data.stream!(source, sink; append=append, transforms=transforms)\n    return Data.close!(sink)\nend\n\nIn this example, CSV.jl defines it\'s own high-level function for reading from a CSV.Source. In these examples, a CSV.Source is constructed using the fullpath argument, along w/ any extra kwargs.... The sink can be provided as a type with args... and kwargs... that will be passed to its DataStreams constructor, like Sink(sch, streamtype, append, args...; kwargs...); otherwise, an already-constructed Sink can be provided directly (2nd example).\n\nOnce the source is constructed, the data is streamed via the call to Data.stream(source, sink; append=append, transforms=transforms), with the sink being returned.\n\nAnd finally, to \"finish\" the streaming process, Data.close!(sink) is closed, which returns the finalized sink. Note that Data.stream!(source, sink) could be called multiple times with different sources and the same sink, most likely with append=true being passed, to enable the accumulation of several sources into a single sink. A single Data.close!(sink) method should be called to officially close or commit the final sink.\n\nTwo \"builtin\" Source/Sink types that are included with the DataStreams package are the Data.Table and Data.RowTable types. Data.Table is a NamedTuple of AbstractVectors, with column names as NamedTuple fieldnames. This type supports both Data.Field and Data.Column streaming. Data.RowTable is just a Vector of NamedTuples, and as such, only supports Data.Field streaming.\n\nIn addition, any Data.Source can be iterated via the Data.rows(source) function, which returns a NamedTuple-iterator over the rows of a source.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
