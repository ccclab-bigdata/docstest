    "text": "(Image: Build Status) (Image: Coverage Status)This package (abbreviated UNSflow) is a library of low-order solvers for unsteady aerodynamics and aeroelasticity managed by Dr. Kiran Ramesh at the University of Glasgow. The solvers are written in Julia, are based on the discrete-vortex method and cater to various applications.This project is currently supported by EPSRC grant EP/R008035/1.Julia is a new high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing. Juliaâ€™s novel features are a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library. Julia is fully open-source under the MIT license, and integrates mature, best-of-breed open source C and Fortran libraries for various computing algorithms."

These can be used to create plots and movies of the\nflowfield.\n\n`delvort` is used to control the vortex count. The simulation cost\nincreases as O(n``^2``) with number of vortices in the flow field and so\nlong run times can get very computationally expensive. Look at\n`?delVortDef` for algorthims to control vortex count.\n\n`maxwrite` is the maximum number of timestamps/directories that may be\nwritten.\n\n`nround` is the number of digits to which the output timestamps are\nrounded off to.\n\nThe Large-Angle Unsteady Thin-Airfoil theory is described in: Ramesh,\nK. et al., \"An unsteady airfoil theory applied to pitching motions\nvalidated against experiment and computation\", Theor.
