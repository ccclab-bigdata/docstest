    "text": "ArnoldiMethod.jl provides an iterative method to find a few approximate  solutions to the eigenvalue problem in standard form:Ax = xlambdawhere A is a general matrix of size n times n; and x in mathbbC^n and lambda in mathbbC are eigenvectors and eigenvalues respectively. By  general matrix we mean that A has no special structure. It can be symmetric or non-symmetric and either real or complex.The method is matrix-free, meaning that it only requires multiplication with  the matrix A.The package exports just two functions:partialschur to compute a stable basis for an eigenspace;\npartialeigen to compute an eigendecomposition from a partial Schur decomposition.See Using ArnoldiMethod.jl  on how to use these  functions."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "The underlying algorithm is the restarted Arnoldi method, which be viewed as a mix between a subspace accelerated version of the power method and a truncated  version of the dense QR algorithm.Initially the method was based on the Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method (or IRAM for short), which is the algorithm implemented by ARPACK. This method has a very elegant restarting scheme based on exact QR iterations, but is  unfortunately susceptible to forward instabilities of the QR algorithm.For this reason the Krylov-Schur method is currently embraced in this package, which is mathematically equivalent to IRAM, but has better stability by  replacing exact QR iterations with a direct method that reorders the Schur form. In fact we see Krylov-Schur just as an implementation detail of the Arnoldi  method."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "By design the Arnoldi method is best at finding eigenvalues on the boundary of the convex hull of eigenvalues. For instance eigenvalues of largest modulus and largest or smallest real part. In the case of complex matrices one can target eigenvalues of largest and smallest imaginary part as well.The scope is much broader though, since there is a whole zoo of spectral  transformations possible to find for instance interior eigenvalues or  eigenvalues closest to the imaginary axis.Further, one can solve generalized eigenvalue problems Ax = Bx lambda by applying a suitable spectral transformation as well. Also quadratic eigenvalue  problems can be casted to standard form.See Theory for more information."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "This project started with two goals:Having a native Julia implementation of the eigs function that performs as well as ARPACK. With native we mean that its implementation should be generic and support any number type. Currently the partialschur function  does not depend on LAPACK, and removing the last remnants of direct calls to  BLAS is in the pipeline.\nRemoving the dependency of the Julia language on ARPACK. This goal was already achieved before the package was stable enough, since ARPACK moved to a  separate repository  Arpack.jl."

    "text": "The method does not make assumptions about the type of the matrix; it is  matrix-free.\nConverged Ritz vectors are locked (or deflated).\nImportant matrices and vectors are pre-allocated and operations on the  Hessenberg matrix are in-place; Julia\'s garbage collector can sit back.\nKrylov basis vectors are orthogonalized with repeated classical Gram-Schmidt to ensure they are orthogonal up to machine precision; this is a BLAS-2 operation.\nTo compute the Schur decomposition of the Hessenberg matrix we use a dense  QR algorithm written natively in Julia. It is based on implicit (or Francis)  shifts and handles real arithmetic efficiently.\nLocking and purging of Ritz vectors is done by reordering the Schur form,  which is also implemented natively in Julia. In the real case it is done by casting tiny Sylvester equations to linear systems and solving them with  complete pivoting.\nShrinking the size of the Krylov subspace and changing its basis is done by accumulating all rotations and reflections in a unitary matrix Q, and then simply computing the matrix-matrix product V := V * Q, where V is the  original orthonormal basis. This is not in-place in V, but with good reason:  the dense matrix-matrix product is not memory-bound."

The basic concept would be: The core Arnoldi method performs tedious linear algebra on the projected,  low-dimensional problem, but finally just outputs a change of basis in the form of a unitary matrix Q.\nAppropriate hardware does the change of basis V := V * Q.Similar things should happen for expansion of the subspace and  orthogonalization."

    "text": "When looking for eigenvalues near a specific target sigma, one can get fast  convergence by using a shift-and-invert technique:Ax = lambda Bx iff (A - sigma B)^-1Bx = theta x text where  theta = frac1lambda - sigmaHere we have casted the generalized eigenvalue problem into standard form with a matrix C = (A - sigma B)^-1B Note that theta is large whenever sigma is close to lambda. This means that we have to target the largest  eigenvalues of C in absolute magnitude. Fast convergence is guaranteed  whenever sigma is close enough to an eigenvalue lambda.Again, one should not construct the matrix C explicitly, but rather implement the matrix-vector product LinearAlgebra.mul!(y, C, x). The best way to do so is to factorize A - sigma B up front.Note that this shift-and-invert strategy simplifies when B = I in which case the matrix in standard form is just C = (A - sigma I)^-1ArnoldiMethod.jl does not transform the eigenvalues of C back to the  eigenvalues of (A B) However, the relation is simply  lambda = sigma + theta^-1."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "If B is exactly singular or very ill-conditioned, one cannot work with  C = B^-1A. One can however apply the shift-and-invert method. There is a  catch, since C = (A - sigma B)^-1B has eigenvalues close to zero or exactly zero. When transformed back, these values would corrspond to  lambda = infty The process to remove these eigenvalues is called  purification.ArnoldiMethod.jl does not yet support this purification idea, but it could in  principle be put together along the following lines [MLA]:Start the Arnoldi method with C times a random vector, such that the  initial vector has numerically no components in the null space of C.\nExpand the Krylov subspace with one additional vector and add a zero shift. This corresponds to implicitly multiplying the first vector of the Krylov subspace with C at restart.[MLA]: Meerbergen, Karl, and Alastair Spence. \"Implicitly restarted Arnoldi with purification for the shift-invert transformation.\" Mathematics of Computation of the American Mathematical Society 66.218 (1997): 667-689."
