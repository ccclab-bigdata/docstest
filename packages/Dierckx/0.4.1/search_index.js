    "text": "Julia library for 1-d and 2-d splines(Image: Build Status) (Image: Build status) (Image: Coverage Status)This is a Julia wrapper for the dierckx Fortran library, the same library underlying the spline classes in scipy.interpolate. Some of the functionality here overlaps with Interpolations.jl, a pure-Julia interpolation package.  Take a look at it if you have a use case not covered here.All new development on Dierckx.jl will be for Julia v0.7 and above. The master branch is therefore incompatible with earlier versions of Julia. "

The parameter bc specifies the behavior when evaluating the spline outside the support domain, which is (minimum(x), maximum(x)). The allowed values are \"nearest\", \"zero\", \"extrapolate\", \"error\".\nIn the first form, the number and positions of knots are chosen automatically. The smoothness of the spline is then achieved by minimalizing the discontinuity jumps of the kth derivative of the spline at the knots. The amount of smoothness is determined by the condition that sum((w[i]*(y[i]-spline(x[i])))**2) <= s, with s a given non-negative constant, called the smoothing factor. The number of knots is increased until the condition is satisfied. By means of this parameter, the user can control the tradeoff between closeness of fit and smoothness of fit of the approximation.  if s is too large, the spline will be too smooth and signal will be lost ; if s is too small the spline will pick up too much noise. in the extreme cases the program will return an interpolating spline if s=0.0 and the weighted least-squares polynomial of degree k if s is very large.\nIn the second form, the knots are supplied by the user. There is no smoothing parameter in this form. The program simply minimizes the discontinuity jumps of the kth derivative of the spline at the given knots.evaluate(spl, x)Evalute the 1-d spline spl at points given in x, which can be a 1-d array or scalar. If a 1-d array, the values must be monotonically increasing.derivative(spl, x; nu=1)Evaluate the nu-th derivative of the spline at points in x.integrate(spl, a, b)Definite integral of spline between x=a and x=b.roots(spl; maxn=8)For cubic splines (k=3) only, find roots. Only up to maxn roots are returned. A warning is issued if the spline has more roots than the number returned."
