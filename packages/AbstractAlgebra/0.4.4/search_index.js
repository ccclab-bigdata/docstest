Of course, the types may belong to these abstract types transitively, e.g. Poly{T} actually belongs to AbstractAlgebra.PolyElem{T} which in turn belongs to AbstractAlgebra.RingElem.For parameterised rings, we advise that the types of both the parent objects and element objects to be parameterised by the types of the elements of the base ring (see the function base_ring below for a definition).There can be variations on this theme: e.g. in some areas of mathematics there is a notion of a coefficient domain, in which case it may make sense to parameterise all types by the type of elements of this coefficient domain.

    "category": "section",
    "text": "In many cases, it is desirable to have only one object in the system to represent each ring. This means that if the same ring is constructed twice, elements of the two rings will be compatible as far as arithmetic is concerned.In order to facilitate this, global caches of rings are stored in AbstractAlgebra.jl, usually implemented using dictionaries. For example, the Generic.PolyRing parent objects are looked up in a dictionary PolyID to see if they have been previously defined.Whether these global caches are provided or not, depends on both mathematical and algorithmic considerations. E.g. in the case of number fields, it isn\'t desirable to identify all number fields with the same defining polynomial, as they may be considered with distinct embeddings into one another. In other cases, identifying whether two rings  are the same may be prohibitively expensive. Generally, it may only make sense algorithmically to identify two rings if they were constructed from identical data.If a global cache is provided, it must be optionally possible to construct the parent objects without caching. This is done by passing a boolean value cached to the inner constructor of the parent object. See generic/GenericTypes.jl` for examples of how to construct and handle such caches."

    "text": "parent_type(::Type{MyElem})Returns the type of the corresponding parent object for the given element type. For example, parent_type(Generic.Poly{T}) will return Generic.PolyRing{T}.elem_type(::Type{MyParent})Returns the type of the elements of the ring whose parent object has the given type. This is the inverse of the parent_type function, i.e. elem_type(Generic.PolyRing{T}) will return Generic.Poly{T}.base_ring(R::MyParent)Given a parent object R, representing a ring, this function returns the parent object of any base ring that parameterises this ring. For example, the base ring of the ring of polynomials over the integers would be the integer ring.If the ring is not parameterised by another ring, this function must return Union{}.Note that there is a distinction between a base ring and other kinds of parameters. For example, in the ring mathbbZnmathbbZ, the modulus n is a parameter, but the only base ring is mathbbZ. We consider the ring mathbbZnmathbbZ to have been constructed from the base ring mathbbZ by taking its quotient by a (principal) ideal.parent(f::MyElem)Return the parent object of the given element, i.e. return the ring to which the given element belongs.This is usually stored in a field parent in each ring element. (If the parent objects have mutable struct types, the internal overhead here is just an additional machine  pointer stored in each element of the ring.)For some element types it isn\'t necessary to append the parent object as a field of every element. This is the case when the parent object can be reconstructed just given the type of the elements. For example, this is the case for the ring of integers and in fact for any ring element type that isn\'t parameterised or generic in any way.isdomain_type(::Type{MyElem})Returns true if every element of the given element type (which may be parameterised or an abstract type) necessarily has a parent that is an integral domain, otherwise if this cannot be guaranteed, the function returns false. For example, if MyElem was the type of elements of generic residue rings of a polynomial ring, the answer to the question would depend on the modulus of the residue  ring. Therefore isdomain_type would have to return false, since we cannot guarantee that we are dealing with elements of an integral domain in general. But if the given element type was for rational integers, the answer would be true, since every rational integer has as parent the ring of rational integers, which is an integral domain.Note that this function depends only on the type of an element and cannot access information about the object itself, or its parent.isexact_type(::Type{MyElem})Returns true if every element of the given type is represented exactly. For example, p-adic numbers, real and complex floating point numbers and power series are not exact, as we can only represent them in general with finite truncations. Similarly polynomials and matrices over inexact element types are themselves inexact.Integers, rationals, finite fields and polynomials and matrices over them are always exact.Note that MyElem may be parameterised or an abstract type, in which case every element of every type represented by MyElem must be exact, otherwise the function must return false.Base.hash(f::MyElem, h::UInt)Return a hash for the object f of type UInt. This is used as a hopefully cheap way to distinguish objects that differ arithmetically. If the object has components, e.g. the coefficients of a polynomial or elements of a matrix, these should be hashed recursively, passing the same parameter h to all levels. Each component should then be xor\'d with h before combining the individual component hashes to give the final hash.The hash functions in AbstractAlgebra.jl usually start from some fixed 64 bit hexadecimal  value that has been picked at random by the library author for that type. That is then truncated to fit a UInt (in case the latter is not 64 bits). This ensures that objects that are the same arithmetically (or that have the same components), but have different types (or structures), are unlikely to hash to the same value.deepcopy_internal(f::MyElem, dict::ObjectIdDict)Return a copy of the given element, recursively copying all components of the object.Obviously the parent, if it is stored in the element, should not be copied. The new element should have precisely the same parent as the old object.For types that cannot self-reference themselves anywhere internally, the dict argument may be ignored.In the case that internal self-references are possible, please consult the Julia documentation on how to implement deepcopy_internal."

    "text": "canonical_unit(f::MyElem)When fractions are created with two elements of the given type, it is nice to be able to represent them in some kind of canonical form. This is of course not always possible. But for example, fractions of integers can be canonicalised by first removing any common factors of the numerator and denominator, then making the denominator positive.In AbstractAlgebra.jl, the denominator would be made positive by dividing both the numerator and denominator by the canonical unit of the denominator. For a negative denominator, this would be -1.For elements of a field, canonical_unit simply returns the element itself. In general, canonical_unit of an invertible element should be that element. Finally, if a = ub we should have the identity canonical_unit(a) = canonical_unit(u)*canonical_unit(b).For some rings, it is completely impractical to implement this function, in which case it may return 1 in the given ring. The function must however always exist, and always return an element of the ring."

It can recursively call the corresponding show functions for any of its components.It may be necessary in some cases to print parentheses around components of f or to print signs of components. For these, the following functions will exist for each component or component type.needs_parentheses(f::MyElem)Should returns true if parentheses are needed around this object when printed, e.g. as a coefficient of a polynomial. As an example, non-constant polynomials would need such parentheses if used as coefficients of another polynomial.displayed_with_minus_in_front(f::MyElem)When printing polynomials, a + sign is usually inserted automatically between terms of the polynomial. However, this is not desirable if the coefficient is negative and that negative sign is already printed when the coefficient is printed.This function must return true if f is printed starting with a negative sign. This suppresses the automatic printing of a + sign by polynomial printing functions that are printing f as a coefficient of a term.Note that if needs_parentheses returns true for f, then displayed_with_minus_in_front should always return false for that f, since an automatic + will need to be printed in front of a coefficient that is printed with parentheses.show_minus_one(::Type{MyElem})When printing polynomials, we prefer to print x rather than 1*x if the degree 1 term has coefficient 1. This can be taken care of without any special support.However, we also prefer to print -x rather than -1*x. This requires special support, since -1 in some rings is not printed as -1 (e.g. -1 in mathbbZ3mathbbZ might be printed as 2). In such rings, show_minus_one should return true.If show_minus_one returns true, polynomial printing functions will not print -x for terms of degree 1 with coefficient -1, but will use the printing function of the given type to print the coefficient in that case."

This means that if the same ring is constructed twice, elements of the two rings will be compatible as far as arithmetic is concerned.In order to facilitate this, global caches of rings are stored in AbstractAlgebra.jl, usually implemented using dictionaries. For example, the Generic.PolyRing parent objects are looked up in a dictionary PolyID to see if they have been previously defined.Whether these global caches are provided or not, depends on both mathematical and algorithmic considerations. E.g. in the case of number fields, it isn\'t desirable to identify all number fields with the same defining polynomial, as they may be considered with distinct embeddings into one another. In other cases, identifying whether two rings  are the same may be prohibitively expensive. Generally, it may only make sense algorithmically to identify two rings if they were constructed from identical data.If a global cache is provided, it must be optionally possible to construct the parent objects without caching. This is done by passing a boolean value cached to the inner constructor of the parent object. See generic/GenericTypes.jl` for examples of how to construct and handle such caches."

For example, parent_type(Generic.Poly{T}) will return Generic.PolyRing{T}.elem_type(::Type{MyParent})Returns the type of the elements of the ring whose parent object has the given type. This is the inverse of the parent_type function, i.e. elem_type(Generic.PolyRing{T}) will return Generic.Poly{T}.base_ring(R::MyParent)Given a parent object R, representing a ring, this function returns the parent object of any base ring that parameterises this ring.If the ring is not parameterised by another ring, this function must return Union{}.parent(f::MyElem)Return the parent object of the given element, i.e. return the ring to which the given element belongs.This is usually stored in a field parent in each ring element. (If the parent objects have mutable struct types, the internal overhead here is just an additional machine  pointer stored in each element of the ring.)For some element types it isn\'t necessary to append the parent object as a field of every element. This is the case when the parent object can be reconstructed just given the type of the elements. For example, this is the case for the ring of integers and in fact for any ring element type that isn\'t parameterised or generic in any way.isexact_type(::Type{MyElem})Returns true if every element of the given type is represented exactly.Note that MyElem may be parameterised or an abstract type, in which case every element of every type represented by MyElem must be exact, otherwise the function must return false.Base.hash(f::MyElem, h::UInt)Return a hash for the object f of type UInt. This is used as a hopefully cheap way to distinguish objects that differ arithmetically. If the object has components, e.g. the coefficients of a polynomial or elements of a matrix, these should be hashed recursively, passing the same parameter h to all levels. Each component should then be xor\'d with h before combining the individual component hashes to give the final hash.The hash functions in AbstractAlgebra.jl usually start from some fixed 64 bit hexadecimal  value that has been picked at random by the library author for that type. That is then truncated to fit a UInt (in case the latter is not 64 bits). This ensures that objects that are the same arithmetically (or that have the same components), but have different types (or structures), are unlikely to hash to the same value.deepcopy_internal(f::MyElem, dict::ObjectIdDict)Return a copy of the given element, recursively copying all components of the object.Obviously the parent, if it is stored in the element, should not be copied. The new element should have precisely the same parent as the old object.For types that cannot self-reference themselves anywhere internally, the dict argument may be ignored.In the case that internal self-references are possible, please consult the Julia documentation on how to implement deepcopy_internal."

However, this is not desirable if the coefficient is negative and that negative sign is already printed when the coefficient is printed.This function must return true if f is printed starting with a negative sign. This suppresses the automatic printing of a + sign by polynomial printing functions that are printing f as a coefficient of a term.Note that if needs_parentheses returns true for f, then displayed_with_minus_in_front should always return false for that f, since an automatic + will need to be printed in front of a coefficient that is printed with parentheses.show_minus_one(::Type{MyElem})When printing polynomials, we prefer to print x rather than 1*x if the degree 1 term has coefficient 1. This can be taken care of without any special support.However, we also prefer to print -x rather than -1*x. This requires special support, since -1 in some rings is not printed as -1 (e.g. -1 in mathbbZ3mathbbZ might be printed as 2). In such rings, show_minus_one should return true.If show_minus_one returns true, polynomial printing functions will not print -x for terms of degree 1 with coefficient -1, but will use the printing function of the given type to print the coefficient in that case."

The required interface here should be implemented, even if it is not optimal. But it can be extended, either by implementing one of the optional interfaces, or by extending the required interface in some other way.Naturally, any multivariate polynomial ring implementation provides the full Ring interface, in order to be treated as a ring for the sake of AbstractAlgebra.jl.Considerations which make it impossible for AbstractAlgebra.jl to provide generic functionality on top of an arbitrary multivariate module include:orderings (lexical, degree, weighted, block, arbitrary)\nsparse or dense representation\ndistributed or recursive representation\npacked or unpacked exponents\nexponent bounds (and whether adaptive or not)\nrandom access or iterators\nwhether monomials and polynomials have the same type\nwhether special cache aware data structures such as Geobuckets are used"

Multivariate polynomial rings should at least be distinguished based on their base (coefficient) ring and number of variables.

    "text": "Capped relative power series have their maximum relative precision capped at some value prec_max. This means that if the leading term of a nonzero power series element is c_ax^a and the precision is b then the power series is of the form  c_ax^a + c_a+1x^a+1 + ldots + O(x^a + b).The zero power series is simply taken to be 0 + O(x^b).The capped relative model has the advantage that power series are stable multiplicatively. In other words, for nonzero power series f and g we have that divexact(f*g), g) == f.However, capped relative power series are not additively stable, i.e. we do not always have (f + g) - g = f.Similar comments apply to Laurent series.On the other hand, capped absolute power series have their absolute precision capped. This means that if the leading term of a nonzero power series element is c_ax^a and the precision is b then the power series is of the form c_ax^a + c_a+1x^a+1 + ldots + O(x^b).Capped absolute series are additively stable, but not necessarily multiplicatively stable.For all models, the maximum precision is also used as a default precision in the case of coercing coefficients into the ring and for any computation where the result could mathematically be given to infinite precision.In all models we say that two power series are equal if they agree up to the minimum absolute precision of the two power series.Thus, for example, x^5 + O(x^10) == 0 + O(x^5), since the minimum absolute precision is 5.During computations, it is possible for power series to lose relative precision due to cancellation. For example if f = x^3 + x^5 + O(x^8) and g = x^3 + x^6 + O(x^8) then f - g = x^5 - x^6 + O(x^8) which now has relative precision 3 instead of relative precision 5.Amongst other things, this means that equality is not transitive. For example x^6 + O(x^11) == 0 + O(x^5) and x^7 + O(x^12) == 0 + O(x^5) but x^6 + O(x^11) neq x^7 + O(x^12).Sometimes it is necessary to compare power series not just for arithmetic equality, as above, but to see if they have precisely the same precision and terms. For this purpose we introduce the isequal function.For example, if f = x^2 + O(x^7) and g = x^2 + O(x^8) and h = 0 + O(x^2) then f == g, f == h and g == h, but isequal(f, g), isequal(f, h) and isequal(g, h) would all return false. However, if k = x^2 + O(x^7) then isequal(f, k) would return true.There are further difficulties if we construct polynomial over power series. For example, consider the polynomial in y over the power series ring in x over the rationals. Normalisation of such polynomials is problematic. For instance, what is the leading coefficient of (0 + O(x^10))y + (1 + O(x^10))?If one takes it to be (0 + O(x^10)) then some functions may not terminate due to the fact that algorithms may require the degree of polynomials to decrease with each iteration. Instead, the degree may remain constant and simply accumulate leading terms which are arithmetically zero but not identically zero.On the other hand, when constructing power series over other power series, if we simply throw away terms which are arithmetically equal to zero, our computations may have different output depending on the order in which the power series are added!One should be aware of these difficulties when working with power series. Power series, as represented on a computer, simply don\'t satisfy the axioms of a ring. They must be used with care in order to approximate operations in a mathematical power series ring.Simply increasing the precision will not necessarily give a \"more correct\" answer and some computations may not even terminate due to the presence of arithmetic zeroes!An absolute power series ring over a ring R with precision p behaves  very much like the quotient Rx(x^p) of the polynomial ring over R. Therefore one can often treat absolute power series rings as though they were rings. However, this depends on all series being given a precision equal to the specified maximum precision and not a lower precision."

    "text": "Puiseux series have their maximum relative precision capped at some value prec_max. This refers to the internal Laurent series used to store the Puiseux series, i.e. the series without denominators in the exponents.The Puiseux series type stores such a Laurent series and a scale or denominator for the exponents. For example, f(x) = 1 + x^13 + 2x^23 + O(x^73) would be stored as a Laurent series 1 + x + 2x^2 + O(x^7) and a scale of 3..The maximum precision is also used as a default (Laurent) precision in the case of coercing coefficients into the ring and for any computation where the result could mathematically be given to infinite precision.In all models we say that two Puiseux series are equal if they agree up to the minimum absolute precision of the two power series.Thus, for example, x^5 + O(x^10) == 0 + O(x^5), since the minimum absolute precision is 5.Sometimes it is necessary to compare Puiseux series not just for arithmetic equality, as above, but to see if they have precisely the same precision and terms. For this purpose we introduce the isequal function.For example, if f = x^2 + O(x^7) and g = x^2 + O(x^8) and h = 0 + O(x^2) then f == g, f == h and g == h, but isequal(f, g), isequal(f, h) and isequal(g, h) would all return false. However, if k = x^2 + O(x^7) then isequal(f, k) would return true.There are a number of technicalities that must be observed when working with Puiseux series. As these are the same as for the other series rings in AbstractAlgebra.jl, we refer the reader to the documentation of series rings for information about these issues."

In each case, the  former is a (parameterised) concrete type for a residue ring over a given base ring whose elements have type T. The latter is an abstract type representing all residue ring types in  AbstractAlgebra.jl, whether generic or very specialised (e.g. supplied by a C library)."

This means that if the same field is constructed twice, elements of the two fields will be compatible as far as arithmetic is concerned.In order to facilitate this, global caches of fields are stored in AbstractAlgebra.jl, usually implemented using dictionaries. For example, the Generic.FracField parent objects are looked up in a dictionary FracDict to see if they have been previously defined.Whether these global caches are provided or not, depends on both mathematical and algorithmic considerations. E.g. in the case of number fields, it isn\'t desirable to identify all number fields with the same defining polynomial, as they may be considered with distinct embeddings into one another. In other cases, identifying whether two fields are the same may be prohibitively expensive. Generally, it may only make sense algorithmically to identify two fields if they were constructed from identical data.If a global cache is provided, it must be optionally possible to construct the parent objects without caching. This is done by passing a boolean value cached to the inner constructor of the parent object. See generic/GenericTypes.jl` for examples of how to construct and handle such caches."

All functionality of permutations is accesible in the Generic submodule.Permutations are represented internally via vector of integers, wrapped in type perm{T}, where T<:Integer carries the information on the type of elements of a permutation. Permutation groups are singleton parent objects of type PermGroup{T} and are used mostly to store the length of a permutation, since it is not included in the permutation type.Permutation groups are created using the PermGroup (inner) constructor. However, for convenience we definePermutationGroup = PermGroupso that permutation groups can be created using PermutationGroup instead of PermGroup.Both PermGroup and perm and can be parametrized by any type T<:Integer . By default the parameter is the Int-type native to the systems architecture. However, if you are sure that your permutations are small enough to fit into smaller integer type (such as Int32, Uint16, or even Int8), you may choose to change the parametrizing type accordingly. In practice this may result in decreased memory footprint (when storing multiple permutations) and noticable faster performance, if your workload is heavy in operations on permutations, which e.g. does not fit into cache of your cpu.All the permutation group types belong to the Group abstract type and the corresponding permutation element types belong to the GroupElem abstract type.Generic.setpermstyle"

They contain the row and column numbers (or degree, in the case of matrix algebras) and the base ring on a per matrix basis. The parent object can then be reconstructed from this data on demand."

    "text": "A matrix space in AbstractAlgebra.jl represents a collection of all matrices with given dimensions and base ring.In order to construct matrices in AbstractAlgebra.jl, one can first construct the matrix space itself. This is accomplished with the following constructor. We discuss creation of matrix algebras separately in a dedicated section elsewhere in the documentation.MatrixSpace(R::Ring, rows::Int, cols::Int; cache::Bool=true)Construct the space of matrices with the given number of rows and columns over the given base ring. By default such matrix spaces are cached based on the base ring and numbers of rows and columns. If the optional named parameter cached is set to false, no caching occurs.Here are some examples of creating matrix spaces and making use of the resulting parent objects to coerce various elements into the matrix space.ExamplesR, t = PolynomialRing(QQ, \"t\")\nS = MatrixSpace(R, 3, 3)\n\nA = S()\nB = S(12)\nC = S(R(11))We also allow matrices over a given base ring to be constructed directly (see the Matrix interface)."

Other classes that inherit from SetMap are FunctionalMap for maps that are constructed from a Julia function (or closure), and IdentityMap for the class of the identity maps within the system.One might naturally assume that map types belong directly to these classes in the way that types of other objects in the system belong to abstract types in the AbstractAlgebra type hierarchy. However, in order to provide an extensible system, this is not the case.Instead, a map type MyMap will belong to an abstract type of the form Map{D, C, T, MyMap}, where D is the type of the object representing the domain of the map type (this can also be an abstract type, such as Group), C is the type of the object representing the codomain of the map type and T is the map class that MyMap belongs to, e.g. SetMap or FunctionalMap.Because a four parameter type system becomes quite cumbersome to use, we provide a number of functions for referring to collections of map types.If writing a function that accepts any map type, one makes the type of its argument belong to Map. For example f(M::Map) = 1.If writing a function that accepts any map from a domain of type D to a codomain of type C, one makes writes for example f(M::Map{D, C}) = 2. Note that D and C can be abstract types, such as Group, but otherwise must be the types of the parent objects representing the domain and codomain.A function that accepts any map belonging to a given map class might be written as f(M::Map(FunctionalMap)) = 3 or f(M::Map(FunctionalMap){D, C}) = 4 for example, where D and C are the types of the parent objects for the domain and codomain.Finally, if a function should only work for a map of a given map type MyMap, say, one writes this f(M::Map(MyMap)) or f(M::Map(MyMap){D, C}, where as usual D and C are the types of the domain and codomain parent objects."

Rather than access this field by writing M.foo, one must access it using foo(M) (at least until Julia 1.1).If such a getter only needs to access the field foo of M, there is a standard way of defining such a getter and setter when defining a new map type.foo(M::Map(MyMap)) = get_field(M, :foo)To set a field of a map, one needs a setter, which can be implemented as follows:set_foo!(M::Map(MyMap), a) = set_field(M, :foo, a)In general, setters should be used rarely for map types.Note that by providing getter and setter functions, map types need not even contain fields with the given name. For example, for a MyMap map type for maps between integers, one does not wish to explicitly store the domain and codomain in MyMap.

It is only necessary to define these functions if the map type MyMap does not contain fields domain and codomain containing these parent objects.It is also necessary to be able to apply a map. This amounts to overloading the call method for objects belonging to Map(MyMap).(M::Map(MyMap)(a))Apply the map M to the element a of the domain of M.

Identity maps can therefore serve as a starting point when building up a composition of maps, starting an identity map.We do not cached identity maps in the system, so that if more than one is created on the same domain, there will be more than one such map in the system. This underscores the fact that there is in general no way for the system to know if two maps compose to give an identity map, and therefore the only two maps that can be composed to give an identity map are identity maps on the same domain.To construct an identity map for a given domain, specified by a parent object R, say, we have the following function.identity_map(R::D) where D <: SetReturn an identity map on the domain R.Of course there is nothing stopping a map type or class from implementing its own identity map type, and defining composition of maps of the same kind with such an identity map. In such a case, the class of such an identity map type must belong to AbstractAlgebra.IdentityMap so that composition with other map types still works."

    "text": "Any two compatible maps in AbstractAlgebra can be composed and any composition can be applied.In order to facilitate this, the Generic module provides a type CompositionMap{D, C}, which contains two maps map1 and map2, corresponding to the two maps to be applied in a composition, in the order they should be applied.To construct a composition map from two existing maps, we have the following function:compose(f::Map{D, U}, g::Map{U, C}) where {D, U, C}Compose the two maps f and g, i.e. return the map h such that h(x) = g(f(x)).As a shortcut for this function we have the following operator:*(f::Map{D, U}, g::Map{U, C}) where {D, U, C} = compose(f, g)Note the order of composition. If we have maps f  X to Y, g  Y to Z the correct order of the maps in this operator is f*g, so that (f*g)(x) = g(f(x)).This is chosen so that for left R-module morphisms represented by a matrix, the order of matrix multiplication will match the order of composition of the corresponding morphisms.Of course, a custom map type or class of maps can implement its own composition type and compose function.This is the case with the FunctionalMap class for example, which caches the Julia function/closure corresponding to the composition of two functional maps. As this cached function needs to be stored inside the composition, a special type is necessary for the composition of two functional maps.By default, compose will check that the two maps are composable, i.e. the codomain of the first map matches the domain of the second map. This is implemented by the following function:check_composable(f::Map{D, U}, g::Map{U, C})Raise an exception if the codomain of f doesn\'t match the domain of g.Note that composite maps should keep track of the two maps they were constructed from. To access these maps, the following functions are provided:map1(f::CompositeMap)\nmap2(f::CompositeMap)Any custom composite map type must also provide these functions for that map type, even if there exist fields with those names. This is because there is no common map class for all composite map types. Therefore the Generic system cannot provide fallbacks for all such composite map types."

This can be useful if the map is extremely difficult to evaluate, e.g. a discrete logarithm map. Rather than evaluate the map afresh each time, the map first looks up the dictionary of previous known values of the map.To facilitate caching of maps, the Generic module provides a type Generic.MapCache, which can be used to wrap any existing map object with a dictionary.Importantly, the supertype of the resulting MapCache object is identical to that of the map being cached.

    "text": "Naively, one might have expected that rings in AbstractAlgebra.jl could be modeled as types and their elements as objects with the given type. But there are various reasons why this is not a good model.Consider the ring R = mathbbZnmathbbZ for a multiprecision integer n. If we were to model the ring R as a type, then the type would somehow need to contain the modulus n. This is not possible in Julia, and in fact it is not desirable, since the compiler would then recompile all the associated functions every time a different modulus n was used.We could attach the modulus n to the objects representing elements of the ring, rather than their type.But now we cannot create new elements of the ring mathbbZnmathbbZ given only their type, since the type no longer contains the modulus n.Instead, the way we get around this in AbstractAlgebra.jl is to have special (singleton) objects that act like types, but are really just ordinary Julia objects. These objects, called parent objects can contain extra information, such as the modulus n. In order to create new elements of mathbbZnmathbbZ as above, we overload the call operator for the parent object.In the following AbstractAlgebra.jl example, we create the parent object R corresponding to the ring mathbbZ7mathbbZ. We then create a new element a of this ring by calling the parent object R.R = ResidueRing(ZZ, 7)\na = R(3)Here, R is the parent object, containing the modulus 7. So this example creates  the element a = 3 pmod7."
