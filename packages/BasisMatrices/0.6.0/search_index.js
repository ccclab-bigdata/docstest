To understand how they are different, we need to see the structure of the BasisMatrix type:mutable struct BasisMatrix{BST<:ABSR, TM<:AbstractMatrix}\n    order::Matrix{Int}\n    vals::Matrix{TM}\nendThe order field keeps track of what order of derivative or integral the arrays inside vals correspond to.The content inside vals will vary based on the type Parameter BST<:AbstractBasisMatrixRep:for BST==Tensor vals will store the evaluation of the basis functions at each of the integration nodes independently. Thus, the [d, i] element will be the derivative order d Basis at the interpolation nodes along the ith dimension (each column is a basis function, each row is an interpolation node). This is the most compact and memory efficient representation\nFor BST==Direct vals will expand along the first dimension (rows) of the array so that for each i, the [d, i] element will have length(basis) rows and basis.n[i] (modulo loss or addition of basis functions from derivative/integral operators.)\nFor BST==Expanded vals will be expanded along both the rows and the columns and will contain a single Matrix for each desired derivative order. This format is the least memory efficient, but simplest conceptually for thinking about how to compute a coefficient vector (if y is f(x) then coefs[d] = b.vals[d] \\ y)See the file demo/basismatformats.jl for a more detailed description of the basis matrix formats."

It also holds a BasisMatrix for the evaluation of the basis matrices at the interpolation nodes. This means that if the coefficient vector needs to be updated, this BasisMatrix will not be re-computed."
