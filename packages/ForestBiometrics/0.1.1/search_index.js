    "text": "A package for various forest mensuration and biometrics functions in JuliaForestBiometrics.jl is a package for working with forest measurements data and growth and yield modeling. This package was inspired by its R counterpart, the lmfor package with the addition of equations from the western US. For more info on lmfor, please see http://cs.uef.fi/~lamehtat/rcodes.htmIt is my hope that the package not only ports existing functionality from other langauges, but also showcases the abilities of Julia as a programming language and how concepts like multiple dispatch and metaprogramming can be used to solve domain-specific problems."

As previously mentioned, it is my hope that this package will not only provide functionality but also be used to examine Julia in the context of forestry specific use cases."
