    "text": "SolveDSGE is a Julia package for solving Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models.  The package is aimed at macroeconomists interested in first-order-accurate or second-order-accurate solutions to their general equilibrium models.  SolveDSGE offers a broad array of solution methods that can be applied provided the DSGE model can be expressed in one of several standard dynamic representations."

    "text": "SolveDSGE allows rational expectations equilibria to be computed using a variety of methods.  The appropriate method to use depends on how the (linearized) model is expressed.  The following model forms are accommodated:Blanchard and Kahn (1980)\nKlein (2000)\nSims (2001)\nBinder and Pesaran (1995)"
