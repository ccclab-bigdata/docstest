    "text": "(Image: Build Status)(Image: DOI)This Julia package provides fast low-rank approximation algorithms for BLAS/LAPACK-compatible matrices based on some of the latest technology in adaptive randomized matrix sketching. Currently implemented algorithms include:sketch methods:\nrandom Gaussian\nrandom subset\nsubsampled random Fourier transform\nsparse random Gaussian\npartial range finder\npartial factorizations:\nQR decomposition\ninterpolative decomposition\nsingular value decomposition\nHermitian eigendecomposition\nCUR decomposition\nspectral norm estimationBy \"partial\", we mean essentially that these algorithms are early-terminating, i.e., they are not simply post-truncated versions of their standard counterparts. There is also support for \"matrix-free\" linear operators described only through their action on vectors. All methods accept a number of options specifying, e.g., the rank, estimated absolute precision, and estimated relative precision of approximation.Our implementation borrows heavily from the perspective espoused by N. Halko, P.G. Martinsson, J.A. Tropp. Finding structure with randomness: Probabilistic algorithms for constructing approximate matrix decompositions. SIAM Rev. 53 (2): 217-288, 2011., except that we choose the interpolative decomposition (ID) as our basic form of approximation instead of matrix range projection. The reason is that the latter requires expensive matrix-matrix multiplication to contract to the relevant subspace, while the former can sometimes be computed much faster, depending on the accelerated sketching strategy employed.This package has been developed with performance in mind, and early tests have shown large speedups over similar codes written in MATLAB and Python (and even some in Fortran and C). For example, computing an ID of a Hilbert matrix of order 1024 to relative precision ~1e-15 takes:~0.02 s using LowRankApprox in Julia\n~0.07 s using SciPy in Python (calling a Fortran backend; see PyMatrixID)\n~0.3 s in MATLABThis difference can be attributed in part to both algorithmic improvements as well as to some low-level optimizations."

    "text": "To illustrate the usage of this package, let\'s consider the computation of a partial QR decomposition of a Hilbert matrix, which is well known to have low rank. First, we load LowRankApprox via:using LowRankApproxThen we construct a Hilbert matrix with:n = 1024\nA = matrixlib(:hilb, n, n)A partial QR decomposition can then be computed using:F = pqrfact(A)This returns a PartialQR factorization with variables Q, R, and p denoting the unitary, trapezoidal, and permutation factors, respectively, constituting the decomposition. Alternatively, these can be extracted directly with:Q, R, p = pqr(A)but the factorized form is often more convenient as it also implements various arithmetic operations. For example, the commands:x = rand(n)\ny = F *x\nz = F\'*xautomatically invoke specialized multiplication routines to rapidly compute y and z using the low-rank structure of F.The rank of the factorization can be retrieved by F[:k], which in this example usually gives 26 or 27. The reason for this variability is that the default interface uses randomized Gaussian sketching for acceleration. Likewise, the actual approximation error is also random but can be efficiently and robustly estimated:aerr = snormdiff(A, F)\nrerr = aerr / snorm(A)This computes the absolute and relative errors in the spectral norm using power iteration. Here, the relative error achieved should be on the order of machine epsilon. (You may see a warning about exceeding the iteration limit, but this is harmless in this case.)The default interface requests ~1e-15 estimated relative precision. To request, say, only 1e-12 relative precision, use:F = pqrfact(A, rtol=1e-12)which returns a factorization of rank ~22. We can also directly control the rank instead with, e.g.:F = pqrfact(A, rank=20)Using both together as in:F = pqrfact(A, rank=20, rtol=1e-12)sets two separate termination criteria: one on reaching rank 20 and the other on achieving estimated relative precision 1e-12â€“-with the computation completing upon either of these being fulfilled. Many other options are available as well. All keyword arguments can also be encapsulated into an LRAOptions type for convenience. For example, we can equivalently write the above as:opts = LRAOptions(rank=20, rtol=1e-12)\nF = pqrfact(A, opts)For further details, see the Options section.All aforementioned considerations also apply when the input is a linear operator, i.e., when the matrix is described not by its entries but by its action on vectors. To demonstrate, we can convert A to type LinearOperator as follows:L = LinearOperator(A)which inherits and stores methods for applying the matrix and its adjoint. (This command actually recognizes A as Hermitian and forms L as a HermitianLinearOperator.) A partial QR decomposition can then be computed with:F = pqrfact(L)just as in the previous case. Of course, there is no real benefit to doing so in this particular example; the advantage comes when considering complicated matrix products that can be represented implicitly as a single LinearOperator. For instance, A*A can be represented as L*L without ever forming the resultant matrix explicitly, and we can even encapsulate entire factorizations as linear operators to exploit fast multiplication:L = LinearOperator(F)Linear operators can be scaled, added, and composed together using the usual syntax. All methods in LowRankApprox transparently support both matrices and linear operators."

    "text": "We now detail the various low-rank approximations implemented, which all nominally return compact Factorization types storing the matrix factors in structured form. All such factorizations provide optimized multiplication routines. Furthermore, the rank of any factorization F can be queried with F[:k] and the matrix approximant defined by F can be reconstructed as full(F). For concreteness of exposition, assume in the following that A has size m by n with factorization rank F[:k] = k.

The factorization form additionally supports least squares solution by left-division.We can also compute a partial QR decomposition of A\' (that is, pivoting on rows instead of columns) without necessarily constructing the matrix transpose explicitly by writing:F = pqrfact(:c, A, args...)and similarly with pqr. The default interface is equivalent to, e.g.:F = pqrfact(:n, A, args...)for \"no transpose\". It is also possible to generate only a subset of the partial QR factors for further efficiency; see Options.The above methods do not modify the input matrix A and may make a copy of the data in order to enforce this (whether this is actually necessary depends on the type of input and the sketch method used). Potentially more efficient versions that reserve the right to overwrite A are available as pqrfact! and pqr!, respectively."

For an m by n matrix A, a sketch of order k takes the form B = S*A, where S is a k by m sampling matrix (see below). Sketches can similarly be constructed for sampling from the right or for multiplying against A\'. The idea is that B contains a compressed representation of A up to rank approximately k, which can then be efficiently processed to recover information about A.The default sketch method defines S as a Gaussian random matrix. Other sketch methods can be specified using the keyword sketch. For example, setting:opts = LRAOptions(sketch=:srft, args...)or equivalently:opts = LRAOptions(args...)\nopts.sketch = :srftthen passing to, e.g.:V = idfact(A, opts)computes an ID with sketching via a subsampled random Fourier transform (SRFT).

This computes, e.g., B = S*(A*A\')^p*A (or simply B = S*A^(p + 1) if A is Hermitian) instead of just B = S*A, with all intermediate matrix products orthogonalized for stability.For generic A, Gaussian sketching has complexity O(k*m*n).

For example, computing an ID via an RRQR guarantees that the interpolation matrix T satisfies maxabs(T) < 1 + maxdet_tol (assuming no early termination due to maxdet_niter).The parameters atol and rtol are also used for the spectral norm estimation routines snorm and snormdiff to specify the requested precision of the (scalar) norm output."
