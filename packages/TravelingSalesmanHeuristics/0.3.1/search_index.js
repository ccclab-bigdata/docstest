    "text": "TravelingSalesmanHeuristics implements basic heuristics for the traveling salesman problem.  As of 2017-7-13, TravelingSalesmanHeuristics implements the nearest neighbor, farthest insertion, and cheapest insertion strategies for path generation, the 2-opt strategy for path refinement, and a simulated annealing heuristic which can be used for path generation or refinement. A simple spanning tree type lower bound is also implemented."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Though the traveling salesman problem is the canonical NP-hard problem, in practice heuristic methods are often unnecessary. Modern integer programming solvers such as CPLEX and Gurobi can quickly provide excellent (even certifiably optimal) solutions. If you are interested in solving TSP instances to optimality, I highly recommend the JuMP package. Even if you are not concerned with obtaining truly optimal solutions, using a mixed integer programming solver is a promising strategy for finding high quality TSP solutions. If you would like to use an integer programming solver along with JuMP but don\'t have access to commercial software, GLPK can work well on relatively small instances.Use of this package is most appropriate when you want decent solutions to small or moderate sized TSP instances with a minimum of hassle: one-off personal projects, if you can\'t install a mixed integer linear programming solver, prototyping, etc.A word of warning: the heuristics implemented areheuristics, meaning you won\'t get any optimality guarantees and, except on very small instances, are unlikely to find the optimal tour;\ngeneral purpose, meaning they do not take advantage of any problem specific structure;\nsimple and (hopefully) readable but not terribly high performance, meaning you may have trouble with large instances. In particular the two-opt path refinement strategy slows down noticeably when there are >400 cities."
