Please file any corrections or missing parts of the documentation as issues, or even better, send in a pull request.The Currencies module exports the Monetary type. To access currencies, use the @usingcurrencies macro. Basic operation is as follows:@usingcurrencies USD\n1USD + 2USD  # 3.00 USD\n3 * 1.5USD   # 4.50 USDMixed arithmetic is not supported:@usingcurrencies USD, CAD\n10USD + 3CAD  # ArgumentErrorMonetary amounts can be compared:@usingcurrencies USD, EUR\n1USD < 2USD        # true\nsort([2EUR, 1EUR]) # [1EUR, 2EUR]"

    "text": "A representation of a monetary value, denominated in some currency. The currency used is part of the type and not the object. The value is internally represented as a quantity of some integer type. The usual way to construct a Monetary directly, if needed, is:\n\nMonetary(:USD)      # 1.00 USD\nMonetary(:USD, 325) # 3.25 USD\n\nBe careful about the decimal point, as the Monetary constructor takes an integer, representing the number of smallest denominations of the currency. Typically, this constructor is not called directly. It is easier to use the @usingcurrencies macro and the 100USD form instead.\n\nAlthough this type is flexible enough to support values internally represented as any integer type, such as BigInt, it is recommended to use the built-in Int type on your architecture unless you need a bigger type. Do not mix different kinds of internal types. To use a different internal representation, change the type of the second argument to Monetary:\n\nMonetary(:USD, BigInt(100))\n\nIn some applications, the minor denomination of a currency is not precise enough. It is sometimes useful to override the number of decimal points stored. For these applications, a third type parameter can be provided, indicating the number of decimal points to keep after the major denomination:\n\nMonetary{:USD, BigInt, 4}(10000)            # 1.0000 USD\nMonetary(:USD, BigInt(10000); precision=4)  # 1.0000 USD\n\n\n\n\n\n"
