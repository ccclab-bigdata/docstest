This wrapper includes three parts:Installation and direct access to PyDSTool\nA low-level development API and provides some functionality to make directly dealing with the library a little bit easier, but still requires knowledge of PyDSTool itself.\nA high-level API for usage with DifferentialEquationsThe tests show how to use the functionality. It is used as an addon in the DifferentialEquations.jl ecosystem. It is recommended that users use this functionality through DifferentialEquations.jl."
