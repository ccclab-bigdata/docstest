    "text": "FlatBuffers.jl provides native Julia support for reading and writing binary structures following the google flatbuffer schema (see here for a more in-depth review of the binary format).The typical language support for flatbuffers involves utilizing the flatc compiler to translate a flatbuffer schema file (.fbs) into a langugage-specific set of types/classes and methods. See here for the official guide on writing schemas.Currently in Julia, the flatc compiler isn\'t supported, but FlatBuffers.jl provides a native implementation of reading/writing the binary format directly with native Julia types. What does this mean exactly? Basically you can take a schema like:namespace example;\n\ntable SimpleType {\n  x: int = 1;\n}\n\nroot_type SimpleType;and do a straightforward Julia translation like:module Example\n\nusing FlatBuffers\n\ntype SimpleType\n    x::Int32\nend\n\n@DEFAULT SimpleType x=1\n\nendA couple of things to point out:using FlatBuffers was included near the top to bring in the FlatBuffers module; this defines the necessary FlatBuffers.jl machinery for making the schema definitions easier\nint translates to a Julia Int32, see more info on flatbuffer types here\nA default value for the x field in SimpleType was declared after the type with the @DEFAULT macro\nNo root_type definition is necessary in Julia; basically any type defined with type (i.e. not abstract or immutable) can be a valid root table type in Julia.So let\'s see how we can actually use a flatbuffer in Julia:using FlatBuffers, Example # the schema module we defined above\n\nval = Example.SimpleType(2) # create an instance of our type\n\nflatbuffer = FlatBuffers.build!(val) # start and build a flatbuffer for our SimpleType\nval2 = FlatBuffers.read(flatbuffer) # now we can deserialize the value from our flatbuffer, `val2` == `val`\nflatbytes = FlatBuffers.bytes(flatbuffer) # get the serialized bytes of the flatbuffer\nval3 = Flatbuffers.read(Example.SimpleType, flatbytes) # now we can deserialize directly from flatbytesFor more involved examples, see the test suite here."
