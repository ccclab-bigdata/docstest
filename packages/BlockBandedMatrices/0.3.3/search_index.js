    "text": "A BlockBandedMatrix stores the entries in a single vector, ordered by columns. For example, if A is a BlockBandedMatrix with block-bandwidths (A.l,A.u) == (1,0) and the block sizes fill(2, N) where N = 3 is the number of row and column blocks, then A has zero structure[ a_11 a_12 │  ⋅    ⋅\n  a_21 a_22 │  ⋅    ⋅\n  ──────────┼──────────\n  a_31 a_32 │ a_33 a_34\n  a_41 a_42 │ a_43 a_44  \n  ──────────┼──────────\n   ⋅    ⋅   │ a_53 a_54\n   ⋅    ⋅   │ a_63 a_64 ]and is stored in memory via A.data as a single vector by columns, containing:[a_11,a_21,a_31,a_41,a_12,a_22,a_32,a_42,a_33,a_43,a_53,a_63,a_34,a_44,a_54,a_64]The reasoning behind this storage scheme as that each block still satisfies the strided matrix interface, but we can also use BLAS and LAPACK to, for example, upper-triangularize a block column all at once.A BandedBlockBandedMatrix stores the entries as a PseudoBlockMatrix, with the number of row blocks equal to A.l + A.u + 1, and the row block sizes are all A.μ + A.λ + 1. The column block sizes of the storage is the same as the the column block sizes of the BandedBlockBandedMatrix. This is a block-wise version of the storage of BandedMatrix.For example, if A is a BandedBlockBandedMatrix with block-bandwidths (A.l,A.u) == (1,0) and subblock-bandwidths (A.λ, A.μ) == (1,0), and the block sizes fill(2, N) where N = 3 is the number of row and column blocks, then A has zero structure[ a_11  ⋅   │  ⋅    ⋅\n  a_21 a_22 │  ⋅    ⋅\n  ──────────┼──────────\n  a_31  ⋅   │ a_33  ⋅\n  a_41 a_42 │ a_43 a_44  \n  ──────────┼──────────\n   ⋅    ⋅   │ a_53  ⋅\n   ⋅    ⋅   │ a_63 a_64 ]and is stored in memory via A.data as a PseudoBlockMatrix, which has block sizes 2 x 2, containing entries:[a_11 a_22 │ a_33 a_44\n a_21  ×   │ a_43  ×  \n ──────────┼──────────\n a_31 a_42 │ a_53 a_64\n a_41  ×   │ a_63  ×   ]where × is an entry in memory that is not used.The reasoning behind this storage scheme as that each block still satisfies the banded matrix interface."
