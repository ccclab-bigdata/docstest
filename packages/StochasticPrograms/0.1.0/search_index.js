    "text": "StochasticPrograms models recourse problems where an initial decision is taken, unknown parameters are observed, followed by recourse decisions to correct any inaccuracy in the initial decision. The underlying optimization problems are formulated in JuMP.jl. In StochasticPrograms, model instantiation can be deferred until required. As a result, scenario data can be loaded/reloaded to create/rebuild the recourse model at a later stage, possibly on separate machines in a cluster. Another consequence of deferred model instantiation is that StochasticPrograms.jl can provide stochastic programming constructs, such as expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and value of the stochastic solution (VSS), to gain deeper insights about formulated recourse problems. A good introduction to recourse models, and to the stochastic programming constructs provided in this package, is given in Introduction to Stochastic Programming. A stochastic program has a structure that can be exploited in solver algorithms. Therefore, StochasticPrograms provides a structured solver interface, implemented by LShapedSolvers.jl and ProgressiveHedgingSolvers.jl. StochasticPrograms has parallel capabilities, implemented using the standard Julia library for distributed computing."

The provided solver will be used internally when necessary. For clarity, we will still explicitly supply a solver when it is required. Now, we provide model recipes for the first and second stage of the example problem. The first stage is straightforward, and is defined using JuMP syntax inside a @first_stage block:@first_stage sp = begin\n    @variable(model, x₁ >= 40)\n    @variable(model, x₂ >= 20)\n    @objective(model, Min, 100*x₁ + 150*x₂)\n    @constraint(model, x₁ + x₂ <= 120)\nendThe recipe was immediately used to generate an instance of the first stage model.

Moreover, the scenario data is referenced through scenario. Instances of the defined scenario SimpleScenario will be injected to create instances of the second stage model. The second stage recipe is immediately used to generate second stage models for each preloaded scenario. Hence, the stochastic program definition is complete.

Hence, all uncertain parameters in a stochastic program must be identified before defining the models. In brief, StochasticPrograms demands two functions from this abstraction. The discrete probability of a given AbstractScenario occurring should be returned from probability. Also, the expected scenario out of a collection of given AbstractScenarios should be returned by expected. StochasticPrograms provides a convenience macro, @scenario, for creating scenario types that adhere to this abstraction. If the identified uncertain parameters is a collection of numerical values, this is the recommended way to define the required scenario type.using StochasticPrograms\n\n@scenario Example = begin\n    X::Float64\nend\n\ns₁ = ExampleScenario(1., probability = 0.5)\ns₂ = ExampleScenario(5., probability = 0.5)\n\nprintln(\"Probability of s₁: $(probability(s₁))\")\n\ns = expected([s₁, s₂])\n\nprintln(\"Expectation over s₁ and s₂: $s\")\nprintln(\"Expectated X: $(s.scenario.X)\")\nHere, all the required operations are correctly defined.There are some caveats to note. First, the autogenerated requires an additive zero element of the introduced scenario type. For simple numeric types this is autogenerated as well. However, say that we want to extend the above scenario with some vector parameter of size 2:using StochasticPrograms\n\n@scenario Example = begin\n    X::Float64\n    Y::Vector{Float64}\nendIn this case, we must provide an implementation of zero using @zero:using StochasticPrograms\n\n@scenario Example = begin\n    X::Float64\n    Y::Vector{Float64}\n\n    @zero begin\n        return Example(0.0, [0.0, 0.0])\n    end\nend\n\ns₁ = ExampleScenario(1., ones(2), probability = 0.5)\ns₂ = ExampleScenario(5., -ones(2), probability = 0.5)\n\nprintln(\"Probability of s₁: $(probability(s₁))\")\n\ns = expected([s₁, s₂])\n\nprintln(\"Expectation over s₁ and s₂: $s\")\nprintln(\"Expectated X: $(s.scenario.X)\")\nprintln(\"Expectated Y: $(s.scenario.Y)\")Another caveat is that the expected function can only be auto generated for fields that support addition and scalar multiplication with Float64.

    "category": "section",
    "text": "using Random\nRandom.seed!(1)Typically, we do not have exact knowledge of all possible future scenarios. However, we often have access to some model of the uncertainty. For example, scenarios could originate from:A stochastic variable with known distribution\nA time series fitted to data\nA nerual network predictionEven if the exact scenario distribution is unknown, or not all possible scenarios are available, we can still formulate a stochastic program that approximates the model we wish to formulate. This is achieved through a technique called sampled average approximation, which is based on sampling. The idea is to sample a large number n of scenarios with equal probability frac1n and then use them to generate and solve a stochastic program. By the law of large numbers, the result will converge with probability 1 to the \"true\" solution with increasing n.StochasticPrograms accepts AbstractSampler objects in place of AbstractScenario. However, an AbstractSampler is always linked to some underlying AbstractScenario type, which is reflected in the resulting stochastic program as well. Samplers are conviniently created using @sampler. We can define a simple scenario type and a simple sampler as follows:using StochasticPrograms\n\n@scenario Example = begin\n    ξ::Float64\nend\n\n@sampler Example = begin\n    w::Float64\n\n    Example(w::AbstractFloat) = new(w)\n\n    @sample begin\n        w = sampler.w\n        return ExampleScenario(w*randn(), probability = rand())\n    end\nendThis creates a new AbstractSampler type called ExampleSampler, which samples ExampleScenarios. Now, we can create a sampler object and sample a scenariosampler = ExampleSampler(2.)\n\ns = sampler()\n\nprintln(s)\nprintln(\"ξ: $(s.ξ)\")It is possible to create other sampler objects for the ExampleScenario, by providing a new unique name:@sampler Another Example = begin\n    w::Float64\n    d::Float64\n\n    Another(w::AbstractFloat, d::AbstractFloat) = new(w, d)\n\n    @sample begin\n        w = sampler.w\n        d = sampler.d\n        return ExampleScenario(w*randn() + d, probability = rand())\n    end\nend\n\nanother = AnotherSampler(2., 6.)\n\ns = another()\n\nprintln(s)\nprintln(\"ξ: $(s.ξ)\")Now, lets use the first sampler to create a stochastic program:sp = StochasticProgram(sampler)\n\n@first_stage sp = begin\n    @variable(model, x >= 0)\n    @objective(model, Min, x)\nend\n\n@second_stage sp = begin\n    @decision x\n    ξ = scenario.ξ\n    @variable(model, y)\n    @objective(model, Min, y)\n    @constraint(model, y + x == ξ)\nendNow, we can sample 5 scenarios to generate 5 subproblems:sample!(sp, 5)Printing yields:print(sp)Sampled stochastic programs are solved as usual:using GLPKMathProgInterface\n\noptimize!(sp, solver = GLPKSolverLP())\n\nprintln(\"optimal decision: $(optimal_decision(sp))\")\nprintln(\"optimal value: $(optimal_value(sp))\")SSA is a shorthand for the above sequence of commands, which also accepts another sampler object over the same scenario type. For example:using GLPKMathProgInterface\n\nres = SSA(sp, another, 5, solver = GLPKSolverLP())\n\nprintln(\"optimal decision: $(optimal_decision(sp))\")\nprintln(\"optimal value: $res\")The quality of the model can be checked in different ways. One indicator is:VSS(sp, solver = GLPKSolverLP())Another is acquired by evaluating the optimal decision on a larger number of sampled scenarios:x = optimal_decision(sp)\nsample!(sp, 10000)\nevaluate_decision(sp, x, solver = GLPKSolverLP())Again, if the functionality offered by @sampler is not adequate, consider Custom scenarios."

The implementation of expected is somewhat unconventional as it returns the mean of the distribution regardless of how many scenarios are given.We are also free to define custom sampler objects, as long as:The sampler type is a subtype of AbstractSampler\nThe sampler type implements a functor call that performs the samplingWe can implement a sampler that generates exponentially distributed scenarios as follows:struct ExponentialSampler <: AbstractSampler{DistributionScenario{Exponential{Float64}}}\n    distribution::Exponential\n\n    ExponentialSampler(θ::AbstractFloat) = new(Exponential(θ))\nend\n\nfunction (sampler::ExponentialSampler)()\n    ξ = rand(sampler.distribution)\n    return DistributionScenario(sampler.distribution, ξ)\nendNow, lets attempt to define the generalized stochastic program using the available modeling tools:using Ipopt\n\nsampler = ExponentialSampler(2.)\nsp = StochasticProgram(sampler)\n\n@first_stage sp = begin\n    @variable(model, x)\nend\n\n@second_stage sp = begin\n    @decision x\n    ξ = scenario.ξ\n    @variable(model, y)\n    @constraint(model, y == (x - ξ)^2)\n    @objective(model, Min, y)\nendStochastic program with:\n * 0 scenarios of type DistributionScenario\n * 1 decision variable\n * 0 recourse variables\nSolver is default solverThe mean of the given exponential distribution is 20, which is the optimal solution to the general problem. Now, lets sample 1000 exponentially distributed numbers with equal probability:StochasticPrograms.sample!(sp, 1000) # Sample 1000 exponentially distributed scenarios (qualified call due to name clash with Distributions.jl)Stochastic program with:\n * 1000 scenarios of type DistributionScenario\n * 1 decision variable\n * 1 recourse variable\nSolver is default solverBy the law of large numbers, we approach the generalized formulation with increasing sample size. Solving yields:optimize!(sp, solver = IpoptSolver(print_level=0))\n\nprintln(\"Optimal decision: $(optimal_decision(sp))\")\nprintln(\"Optimal value: $(optimal_value(sp))\")Optimal decision: [2.07583]\nOptimal value: 4.00553678799426Now, due to the special implementation of the expected function, it actually holds that the expected value solution solves the generalized problem. Consider:println(\"EVP decision: $(EVP_decision(sp, solver = IpoptSolver(print_level=0)))\")\nprintln(\"VSS: $(VSS(sp, solver = IpoptSolver(print_level=0)))\")EVP decision: [2.0]\nVSS: 0.005750340653017716Accordingly, the VSS is small."

    "text": "Another central idea in StochasticPrograms is deferred model instantiation. Consider again the simple problem introduced in the Quick start, but with some slight differences:using StochasticPrograms\n\n@scenario Simple = begin\n    q₁::Float64\n    q₂::Float64\n    d₁::Float64\n    d₂::Float64\nend\n\nsp = StochasticProgram(SimpleScenario)\n\n@first_stage sp = begin\n    @variable(model, x₁ >= 40)\n    @variable(model, x₂ >= 20)\n    @objective(model, Min, 100*x₁ + 150*x₂)\n    @constraint(model, x₁ + x₂ <= 120)\nend defer\n\n@second_stage sp = begin\n    @decision x₁ x₂\n    ξ = scenario\n    @variable(model, 0 <= y₁ <= ξ.d₁)\n    @variable(model, 0 <= y₂ <= ξ.d₂)\n    @objective(model, Min, ξ.q₁*y₁ + ξ.q₂*y₂)\n    @constraint(model, 6*y₁ + 10*y₂ <= 60*x₁)\n    @constraint(model, 8*y₁ + 5*y₂ <= 80*x₂)\nendThere are two things to note here. First, no scenarios have been loaded yet, so no second stage models were instansiated. Moreover, the first stage was defined with the defer keyword, and the printout states that the first stage is deferred. This means that the first stage model has not yet been instansiated, but the stochastic program instance has a model recipe that can be used to generate it when required:println(has_generator(sp, :stage_1))\nprintln(has_generator(sp, :stage_2))Now, we add the simple scenarios to the stochastic program instance, also with a defer keyword:ξ₁ = SimpleScenario(-24.0, -28.0, 500.0, 100.0, probability = 0.4)\nξ₂ = SimpleScenario(-28.0, -32.0, 300.0, 300.0, probability = 0.6)\nadd_scenarios!(sp, [ξ₁, ξ₂], defer = true)The two scenarios are loaded, but no second stage models were instansiated. Deferred stochastic programs will always be generated in full when required. For instance, this occurs when calling optimize!. Furthermore, we can explicitly instansiate the stochastic program using generate!:generate!(sp)This gives a clear separation between data design and model design, and gives flexibility when defining stochastic programs. The model recipes are also used internally to create different stochastic programming constructs, such as outcome models and wait-and-see models. Moreover, deferred model instantiation is the foundation for the distributed functionality in Stochastic Programs, to be described next."

    "text": "Stochastic programs related to industrial applications are often associated with complex models and vast numbers of scenarios, often in the order of 1000-1000000. Hence, the extensive form can have billions of variables and constraints, and often does not fit in memory on a single machine. This clarifies the need for solution approaches that work in parallel on distributed data when instansiating and optimizing large-scale stochastic programs.If multiple Julia processes are available, locally or in a cluster, StochasticPrograms natively distributes any defined stochastic programs on the available processing nodes. As an example, we revisit the simple problem introduced in the Quick start:using Distributed\n\naddprocs(3)\n\nusing StochasticPrograms\n\n@scenario Simple = begin\n    q₁::Float64\n    q₂::Float64\n    d₁::Float64\n    d₂::Float64\nend@scenario automatically ensures that the introduced scenario type is available on all processes. Define the stochastic program in the usual way:sp = StochasticProgram(SimpleScenario)\n@first_stage sp = begin\n    @variable(model, x₁ >= 40)\n    @variable(model, x₂ >= 20)\n    @objective(model, Min, 100*x₁ + 150*x₂)\n    @constraint(model, x₁ + x₂ <= 120)\nend\n@second_stage sp = begin\n    @decision x₁ x₂\n    ξ = scenario\n    @variable(model, 0 <= y₁ <= ξ.d₁)\n    @variable(model, 0 <= y₂ <= ξ.d₂)\n    @objective(model, Min, ξ.q₁*y₁ + ξ.q₂*y₂)\n    @constraint(model, 6*y₁ + 10*y₂ <= 60*x₁)\n    @constraint(model, 8*y₁ + 5*y₂ <= 80*x₂)\nendDistributed stochastic program with:\n * 0 scenarios of type SimpleScenario\n * 2 decision variables\n * 0 recourse variables\nSolver is default solverThe printout indicates that the created stochastic program is distributed. Technically, nothing has been distributed yet since there are no scenarios. The first stage problem always reside on the master node. Let us now add the two scenarios. We could add the in the usual way with add_scenario!. However, this would create the scenario data on the master node and then send the data. This is fine for this small scenario, but for a large-scale program this would involve a lot of data passing. As stated @scenario made the scenario type available on all nodes, so a better approach is to:add_scenario!(sp; defer = true, w = 2) do\n    return SimpleScenario(-24.0, -28.0, 500.0, 100.0, probability = 0.4)\nend\nadd_scenario!(sp; defer = true, w = 3) do\n    return SimpleScenario(-28.0, -32.0, 300.0, 300.0, probability = 0.6)\nendDistributed stochastic program with:\n * 2 scenarios of type SimpleScenario\n * 2 decision variables\n * deferred second stage\nSolver is default solverThis instansiates the scenarios locally on each node and loads them into local storage. An even more effective paradigm is to only send a lightweight AbstractSampler object to each node, and have them sample any required scenario. This is the recommended approach for large-scale stochastic programs. The model generation was purposefully deferred to make a final point. If we now call:generate!(sp)Distributed stochastic program with:\n * 2 scenarios of type SimpleScenario\n * 2 decision variables\n * 2 recourse variables\nSolver is default solverthe lightweight model recipes are passed to all worker nodes. The worker nodes then use the recipes to instansiate second stage models in parallel. This is one of the intended outcomes of the design choices made in StochasticPrograms. The separation between data design and model design allows us to minimize data passing in a natural way.Many operations in StochasticPrograms are embarassingly parallel which is exploited throughout when a stochastic program is distributed. Notably:evaluate_decision\nEVPI\nVSSPerform many subproblem independent operations in parallel. The best performance is achieved if the optimization of the recourse problem is performed by an algorithm that can operate in parallel on the distributed stochastic programs. The solver suites LShapedSolvers.jl and ProgressiveHedgingSolvers.jl are examples of this. For example, we can optimize the distributed version of the simple stochastic program with a parallelized L-shaped algorithm as follows:using LShapedSolvers\nusing GLPKMathProgInterface\n\noptimize!(sp, solver = LShapedSolver(:dls, GLPKSolverLP()))Distributed L-Shaped Gap  Time: 0:00:03 (6 iterations)\n  Objective:       -855.8333333333339\n  Gap:             0.0\n  Number of cuts:  7\n:OptimalA quick note should also be made about the API calls that become less efficient in a distributed setting. This includes all calls that collect data that reside on remote processes. The functions in this category that involve the most data passing is scenarios, which fetches all scenarios in the stochastic program, and subproblems, which fetches all second stage models in the stochastic program. If these collections are required frequently it is recommended to not distribute the stochastic program. This can be ensured by supplying procs = [1] to the constructor call. Individual queries scenario(stochasticprogram, i) and subproblem(stochasticprogram, i) are viable depending on the size of the scenarios/models. If a MathProgBase solver is supplied to a distributed stochastic program it will fetch all scenarios to the master node and attempt to build the extensive form. Long computation times are expected for large-scale models, assuming they fit in memory. If so, it is again recommended to avoid distributing the stochastic program through procs = [1]. The best approach is to use a structured solver that can operate on distributed stochastic programs, such as LShapedSolvers.jl or ProgressiveHedgingSolvers.jl."

    "text": "The structured solver interface mimics that of MathProgBase, and it needs to be implemented by any structured solver to be compatible with StochasticPrograms. Define a new structured solver as a subtype of AbstractStructuredModel. Moreoever, define a shallow object of type AbstractStructuredSolver. This object is intended to be the interface to end users of the solver and is what should be passed to optimize!. Next, implement StructuredModel, that takes the stochastic program and the AbstractStructuredSolver object and return and instance of AbstractStructuredModel which internal state depends on the given stochastic program. Next, the solver algorithm should be run when calling optimize_structured! on the AbstractStructuredModel. After successfuly optimizing the model, the solver must be able to fill in the optimal solution in the first stage and all second stages through fill_solution!.Some procedures in StochasticPrograms require a MathProgBase solver. It is common that structured solvers rely internally on some MathProgBase solver. Hence, for convenience, a structured solver can implement internal_solver to return any internal MathProgBase solver. A stochastic program that has an loaded structured solver that implements this method can then make use of that solver for those procedures, instead of requiring an external solver to be supplied. Finally, a structured solver can optionally implement solverstr to return an informative description string for printouts.As an example, a simplified version of the implementation of the structured solver interface in LShapedSolvers.jl is given below:abstract AbstractLShapedSolver <: AbstractStructuredModel end\n\nconst MPB = MathProgBase\n\nmutable struct LShapedSolver <: AbstractStructuredSolver\n    lpsolver::MPB.AbstractMathProgSolver\n    subsolver::MPB.AbstractMathProgSolver\n    checkfeas::Bool\n    crash::Crash.CrashMethod\n    parameters::Dict{Symbol,Any}\n\n    function (::Type{LShapedSolver})(lpsolver::MPB.AbstractMathProgSolver; crash::Crash.CrashMethod = Crash.None(), subsolver::MPB.AbstractMathProgSolver = lpsolver, checkfeas::Bool = false, kwargs...)\n        return new(lpsolver, subsolver, checkfeas, crash, Dict{Symbol,Any}(kwargs))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction StructuredModel(stochasticprogram::StochasticProgram, solver::LShapedSolver)\n    x₀ = solver.crash(stochasticprogram, solver.lpsolver)\n    return LShaped(stochasticprogram, x₀, solver.lpsolver, solver.subsolver, solver.checkfeas; solver.parameters...)\nend\n\nfunction internal_solver(solver::LShapedSolver)\n    return solver.lpsolver\nend\n\nfunction optimize_structured!(lshaped::AbstractLShapedSolver)\n    return lshaped()\nend\n\nfunction fill_solution!(stochasticprogram::StochasticProgram, lshaped::AbstractLShapedSolver)\n    # First stage\n    first_stage = StochasticPrograms.get_stage_one(stochasticprogram)\n    nrows, ncols = first_stage_dims(stochasticprogram)\n    StochasticPrograms.set_decision!(stochasticprogram, decision(lshaped))\n    μ = try\n        MPB.getreducedcosts(lshaped.mastersolver.lqmodel)[1:ncols]\n    catch\n        fill(NaN, ncols)\n    end\n    StochasticPrograms.set_first_stage_redcosts!(stochasticprogram, μ)\n    λ = try\n        MPB.getconstrduals(lshaped.mastersolver.lqmodel)[1:nrows]\n    catch\n        fill(NaN, nrows)\n    end\n    StochasticPrograms.set_first_stage_duals!(stochasticprogram, λ)\n    # Second stage\n    fill_submodels!(lshaped, scenarioproblems(stochasticprogram))\nend"

The problem revolves around a farmer who needs to decide how to partition his land to sow three different crops. The uncertainty comes from not knowing what the future yield of each crop will be. Recourse decisions involve purchasing/selling crops at the market.using StochasticPrograms\nusing GLPKMathProgInterfaceWe begin by introducing some variable indices:Crops = [:wheat, :corn, :beets];\nPurchased = [:wheat, :corn];\nSold = [:wheat,:corn,:beets_quota,:beets_extra];The price of beets drops after a certain quantity (6000), so we introduce an extra variable to handle the excess beets. Using the variable indices, we define the deterministic problem parameters:Cost = Dict(:wheat=>150, :corn=>230, :beets=>260);\nRequired = Dict(:wheat=>200, :corn=>240, :beets=>0);\nPurchasePrice = Dict(:wheat=>238, :corn=>210);\nSellPrice = Dict(:wheat=>170, :corn=>150, :beets_quota=>36, :beets_extra=>10);\nBudget = 500;In the first stage, the farmer needs to know what crops to plant, the cost of planting them, and the available land. Therefore, we introduce the first stage data:first_stage_data = (Crops, Cost, Budget)In the second stage, the farmer needs to know the required quantity of each crop, the purchase price, and the sell price:second_stage_data = (Required, PurchasePrice, SellPrice)The uncertainty lies in the future yield of each crop. We define a scenario type to capture this:@scenario Farmer = begin\n    Yield::Dict{Symbol, Float64}\n\n    @zero begin\n        return FarmerScenario(Dict(:wheat=>0., :corn=>0., :beets=>0.))\n    end\n\n    @expectation begin\n        return FarmerScenario(Dict(:wheat=>sum([probability(s)*s.Yield[:wheat] for s in scenarios]),\n                                   :corn=>sum([probability(s)*s.Yield[:corn] for s in scenarios]),\n                                   :beets=>sum([probability(s)*s.Yield[:beets] for s in scenarios])))\n    end\nendWe provide an implementation of expected since it can not be autogenerated for the internal Dict type. The three predicted outcomes can be defined through:s₁ = FarmerScenario(Dict(:wheat=>3.0,:corn=>3.6,:beets=>24.0), probability = 1/3)\ns₂ = FarmerScenario(Dict(:wheat=>2.5,:corn=>3.0,:beets=>20.0), probability = 1/3)\ns₃ = FarmerScenario(Dict(:wheat=>2.0,:corn=>2.4,:beets=>16.0), probability = 1/3)Now, we create a stochastic program with the defined data:farmer = StochasticProgram(first_stage_data, second_stage_data, [s₁,s₂,s₃], solver=GLPKSolverLP())Finally, we define the optimization models:@first_stage farmer = begin\n    (Crops,Cost,Budget) = stage\n    @variable(model, x[c = Crops] >= 0)\n    @objective(model, Min, sum(Cost[c]*x[c] for c in Crops))\n    @constraint(model, sum(x[c] for c in Crops) <= Budget)\nend\n@second_stage farmer = begin\n    @decision x\n    (Required, PurchasePrice, SellPrice) = stage\n    @variable(model, y[p = Purchased] >= 0)\n    @variable(model, w[s = Sold] >= 0)\n    @objective(model, Min, sum( PurchasePrice[p] * y[p] for p = Purchased) - sum( SellPrice[s] * w[s] for s in Sold))\n\n    @constraint(model, const_minreq[p=Purchased],\n                   scenario.Yield[p] * x[p] + y[p] - w[p] >= Required[p])\n    @constraint(model, const_minreq_beets,\n                   scenario.Yield[:beets] * x[:beets] - w[:beets_quota] - w[:beets_extra] >= Required[:beets])\n    @constraint(model, const_aux, w[:beets_quota] <= 6000)\nendWe can now optimize the model:optimize!(farmer)\nx = optimal_decision(farmer, :x)\nprintln(\"Wheat: $(x[:wheat])\")\nprintln(\"Corn: $(x[:corn])\")\nprintln(\"Beets: $(x[:beets])\")\nprintln(\"Profit: $(optimal_value(farmer))\")Finally, we calculate the stochastic performance of the model:println(\"EVPI: $(EVPI(farmer))\")\nprintln(\"VSS: $(VSS(farmer))\")"
