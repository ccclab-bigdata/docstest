    "text": "In this tutorial we will run through the basics of creating a model and conditioning it.First load Omega:using OmegaIf you tossed a coin and observed the sequqnce HHHHH, you would be a little suspicious, HHHHHHHH would make you very suspicious. Elementary probability theory tells us that for a fair coin, HHHHHHHH is just a likely outcome as HHTTHHTH.  What gives?  We will use Omega to model this behaviour, and see how that belief about a coin changes after observing a number of tosses.Model the coin as a bernoulli distribution.  The weight of a bernoulli determines the probability it comes up true (which represents heads). Use a beta distribution to represent our prior belief weight of the coin.weight = β(2.0, 2.0)A beta distribution is appropriate here because it is bounded between 0 and 1. Draw a 10000 samples from weight using rand:beta_samples = rand(weight, 10000)Let\'s see what this distribution looks like using UnicodePlots.  If you don\'t have it installed already install with:(v0.7) pkg> add UnicodePlotsTo visualize the distribution, plot a histogram of the samples:julia> UnicodePlots.histogram(beta_samples)             ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐ \n   (0.0,0.1] │▇▇▇▇▇▇ 279                              │ \n   (0.1,0.2] │▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 727                   │ \n   (0.2,0.3] │▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 1218       │ \n   (0.3,0.4] │▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 1354    │ \n   (0.4,0.5] │▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 1482 │ \n   (0.5,0.6] │▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 1426  │ \n   (0.6,0.7] │▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 1406   │ \n   (0.7,0.8] │▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 1124         │ \n   (0.8,0.9] │▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 702                    │ \n   (0.9,1.0] │▇▇▇▇▇▇ 282                              │ \n             └────────────────────────────────────────┘The distribution is symmetric around 0.5 and has support over the the interval [0, 1].So far we have not done anything we couldn\'t do with Distributions.jl. A primary distinction between a package like Distribution.jl, is that Omega.jl allows you to condition probability distributions.Create a model representing four flips of the coin. Since a coin can be heads or tales, the appropriate distribution is the bernouli distribution:nflips = 4\ncoinflips_ = [bernoulli(weight) for i = 1:nflips]Take note that weight is the random variable defined previously.coinflips is a normal Julia array of Random Variables (RandVars). For reasons we will elaborate in later sections, it will be useful to have an Array-valued RandVar (instead of an Array of RandVar).One way to do this (there are several ways discuseed later), is to use the function randarraycoinflips = randarray(coinflips_)coinflips is a RandVar and hence we can sample from it with randjulia> rand(coinflips)\n4-element Array{Float64,1}:\n 0.0\n 0.0\n 0.0\n 0.0\n\njulia> rand(coinflips)\n4-element Array{Float64,1}:\n 0.0\n 1.0\n 0.0\n 0.0\n\njulia> rand(coinflips)\n4-element Array{Float64,1}:\n 1.0\n 1.0\n 1.0\n 1.0Now we can condition the model. We want to find the conditional distribution over the weight of the coin given some observations.First create some fake dataobservations = [true, true, true, false]and then use rand to draw conditional samples:weight_samples = rand(weight, coinflips == observations, 10, RejectionSample)weight_samples is a set of 10 samples from the conditional (sometimes called posterior) distribution of weight condition on the fact that coinflips == observations.In this case, rand takesA random variable we want to sample from\nA predicate (type RandVar{Bool}) that we want to condition on, i.e. assert that it is true\nAn inference algorithm.

To create random variables in the explicit style, create a normal julia sampler, but it is essential to pass through the rng object.For instance, to define a bernoulli distribution in explicit style:x_(rng) = rand(rng) > 0.5x_ is just a normal julia function.  We could sample from it by passing in the GLOBAL_RNGjulia> x_(Base.Random.GLOBAL_RNG)\ntrueHowever, in order to use x for conditional or causal inference we must turn it into a RandVar. One way to do this (we discuss others in [conditonalindependence]) is using ciid.x = ciid(x_)All of the primitive distributions can be used in explicit style by passing the rng object as the first parameter (type constraints are added just to show that the return values are not random variables but elements): function x_(rng)\n  if bernoulli(rng, 0.5, Bool)\n    normal(rng, 0.0, 1.0)::Float64\n  else bernoulli(rng, 0.5, Bool)\n    betarv(rng, 2.0, 2.0)::Float64\n  end\nend\n\nciid(x_)Statistical style and functional style can be combined naturally.

Broadly, the model says that the weather outside is dictataed by the time of day, while the temperature inside is determined by whether the air conditioning is on, and whether the window is open.First, setup simple priors over the time of day, and variables to determine whether the air conditioning is on and whether hte iwndow is open:timeofday = uniform([:morning, :afternoon, :evening])\nis_window_open = bernoulli(0.5)\nis_ac_on = bernoulli(0.3)Second, assume that the outside temperature depends on the time of day, being hottest in the afternoon, but cold at night:function outside_temp_(rng)\n  if timeofday(rng) == :morning\n    normal(rng, 20.0, 1.0)\n  elseif timeofday(rng) == :afternoon\n    normal(rng, 32.0, 1.0)\n  else\n    normal(rng, 10.0, 1.0)\n  end\nendRemember, in this style we have to use  ciid to convert a function into a RandVaroutside_temp = ciid(outside_temp_, T=Float64)The inside_temp before considering the effects of the window is room temperature, unless the ac is on, which makes it colder.function inside_temp_(rng)\n  if Bool(is_ac_on(rng))\n    normal(rng, 20.0, 1.0)\n  else\n    normal(rng, 25.0, 1.0)\n  end\nend\n\ninside_temp = ciid(inside_temp_, T=Float64)47:Omega.normal(100.0, 1.0)::Float64Finally, the thermostat reading is inside_temp if the window is closed (we have perfect insulation), otherwise it\'s just the average of the outside and inside temperaturefunction thermostat_(rng)\n  if Bool(is_window_open(rng))\n    (outside_temp(rng) + inside_temp(rng)) / 2.0\n  else\n    inside_temp(rng)\n  end\nend\n\nthermostat = ciid(thermostat_, T=Float64)Now with the model built, we can ask some questions:"
