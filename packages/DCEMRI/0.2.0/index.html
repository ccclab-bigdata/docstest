It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library. The library, largely written in Julia itself, also integrates mature, best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra, random number generation, signal processing, and string processing.</p></blockquote><p>Put simply, it looks like Matlab, which is simple to learn and familiar to most MRI researchers, but it works better and faster and is completely free.  In particular, for the problem of DCE MRI, Julia&#39;s simple and flexible parallel computing model allows almost perfect parallelization of the nonlinear least squares fitting problem.  In my informal testing, the intrinsic speed of Julia coupled to my parallel implementation produced a factor of 20-40 speedup over comparable Matlab and Python.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Installation-1" href="#Installation-1">Installation</a></h2><p>Installation is simple.  First you need Julia. The simplest way to get Julia is to grab the current release version from <a href="http://julialang.org/downloads/">julialang.org</a>.</p><p>Next you need <strong>DCEMRI.jl</strong>.  Open Julia. You should see a terminal window with the <code>julia&gt;</code> prompt.  This is analogous to the command line in Matlab. To install <strong>DCEMRI.jl</strong>, run</p><pre><code class="language-none">julia&gt; Pkg.add(&quot;DCEMRI&quot;)</code></pre><p>at the <code>julia&gt;</code> prompt.  This might take a minute, because the validation data must be downloaded, as well as a few supporting packages.</p><p>If you want to <strong>DCEMRI.jl</strong> to create plots for you, you also need Python with <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> installed. Most OS X and Linux machines probably already have a version of Python with Matplotlib installed. If you don&#39;t have Python with Matplotlib, such as if you are on Windows, you can grab the excellent, free <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda python distribution</a>, which comes with Matplotlib pre-installed.</p><p>If you have installation problems, check the next section on platform specific issues.  If none of that helps, please file an issue at the <a href="http://github.com/davidssmith/DCEMRI.jl">github repository</a>, and we will try to help you.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Platform-Specific-Notes-1" href="#Platform-Specific-Notes-1">Platform Specific Notes</a></h2><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Mac-OS-X-1" href="#Mac-OS-X-1">Mac OS X</a></h3><p>If you get an error that <code>xcrun</code> is missing on Mac OS X, follow the instructions to install the Developer Tools Command Line Tools, and then switch back to your Julia window and run <code>Pkg.build(&quot;HDF5&quot;)</code>.  This should fix everything.  If you don&#39;t get this error, but installation fails, make sure you have Xcode installed, along with the optional Command Line Tools.</p><p>There have also been reports of Julia popping up behind other windows on OS X.  Look behind your windows if you think Julia isn&#39;t starting.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Windows-1" href="#Windows-1">Windows</a></h3><p>On Windows, you will almost certainly need to install <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda</a> to have a Python distribution. Some Windows versions claim to be 64-bit, but aren&#39;t quite.  If you are having trouble on Windows, and you have installed a 64-bit Anaconda and Julia, you can try uninstalling them and installing 32-bit versions of both.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Validating-the-Installation-1" href="#Validating-the-Installation-1">Validating the Installation</a></h2><p>After installing the Julia and the <strong>DCEMRI</strong> module, you should run the validations, to make sure the calculations work correctly on your machine.  The easiest way to do this is to start Julia and then run</p><pre><code class="language-none">julia&gt; using DCEMRI

julia&gt; validate()</code></pre><p>This will run both validations (4 and 6), which could take up to an hour, depending on the number of cores you started Julia with and how fast your hardware is. Examine the results to make sure that the parameters have been recovered accurately.  The text output of the scripts will also print quantitative measures of parameter accuracy. By default validation results will be written to subdirectories of the <strong>DCEMRI.jl</strong> module directory, which is <code>$HOME/.julia/v0.3/DCEMRI</code> on Unix-based systems.  You can customize this directory for the validation by passing the output path as the second argument.  This only works the individual validation functions, e.g. <code>validate(6, &quot;/my/path&quot;)</code> or <code>validate(4, &quot;/my/path&quot;)</code>.  Since both validations write figures with identical names, they can&#39;t go to the same output directory. </p><p>An example output is shown here:</p><pre><code class="language-none">julia&gt; validate(4)

Validation complete. Results can be found in /Users/dss/.julia/v0.3/DCEMRI/test/q4.</code></pre><p>To perform the validation on the Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance phantoms for yourself from the original DICOMS, you will need to download the DICOMS from <a href="https://dblab.duhs.duke.edu/modules/QIBAcontent/index.php?id=1">Daniel Barboriak&#39;s Lab</a>.  Then the scripts in the <code>q4</code> and <code>q6</code> folders will help you translate the DICOM data to MAT files suitable for input into the Julia code.</p><p>I have already done this step for you and included the MAT files.  This also avoids you needing to install Python if you don&#39;t have it already.  If you want to install Python and run the scripts to convert the DICOM data to MAT files, then I recommend the <a href="http://continuum.io">Anaconda</a> Python distribution. It has everything you need for scientific programming with Python.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Running-the-In-Vivo-Demo-1" href="#Running-the-In-Vivo-Demo-1">Running the In Vivo Demo</a></h2><p>You can run the in vivo data demo with the command <code>demo()</code>.  It will save the output by default to <code>$HOME/.julia/v0.3/DCEMRI/demo/results</code> by default.  You can change this location by passing a path string to <code>demo()</code>.

Sometimes, due to numerical accuracy issues, they have been converted internally. But all data should be supplied to the code in SI units.  In particular, time should be in seconds, and relaxation rates in inverse seconds.  The two exceptions to this rule are that flip angles should be in degrees and Ktrans is output in min^-1.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Running-the-Code-1" href="#Running-the-Code-1">Running the Code</a></h2><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="As-a-Julia-module-1" href="#As-a-Julia-module-1">As a Julia module</a></h3><p>In the simplest incarnation, if you already have a MAT file containing your data,  you can run the analysis from within Julia using</p><pre><code class="language-none">julia&gt; using DCEMRI
