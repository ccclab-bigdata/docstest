    "text": "It is best to explain the problem (and solution) by example <sup>1</sup>. Suppose Peter and his friend Jarrett have both developed eponymous modules Peter and Jarrett as follows:module Peter\n  import Base.+\n\n  struct PeterNumber <: Number\n    x::Number\n  end\n\n  Base.:+(p::PeterNumber, y::Number) = PeterNumber(p.x + y)\n\n  export PeterNumber\nend\n\nmodule Jarrett\n  import Base.+\n\n  struct JarrettNumber <: Number\n    y::Number\n  end\n\n  Base.:+(x::Number, j::JarrettNumber) = JarrettNumber(x + j.y)\n\n  export JarrettNumber\nendPeter and Jarrett have both defined fun numeric types! However, look what happens when the user tries to use Peter\'s and Jarrett\'s numbers together...julia> using .Peter\n\njulia> using .Jarrett\n\njulia> p = PeterNumber(1.0) + 3\nPeterNumber(4.0)\n\njulia> j = 2.0 + JarrettNumber(2.0)\nJarrettNumber(4.0)\n\njulia> friends = p + j\nERROR: MethodError: +(::PeterNumber, ::JarrettNumber) is ambiguous. Candidates:\n  +(x::Number, j::JarrettNumber) in Main.Jarrett at REPL[2]:8\n  +(p::PeterNumber, y::Number) in Main.Peter at REPL[1]:8\nPossible fix, define\n  +(::PeterNumber, ::JarrettNumber)Oh no! Since a PeterNumber is a Number and a JarrettNumber is a Number, both + methods are applicable, and neither method is more specific. Julia has no way to decide which method to use, and asks the user to decide by defining a more specific method.There is a question of what role developers should play in the resolution of this ambiguity.All developers can coordinate their efforts to agree on how their typesshould interact, and then define methods for each interaction. This solution is unrealistic since it poses an undue burden of communication on the developers and since multiple behaviors may be desired for an interaction between types. In the above example, the two definitions of + have different behavior and either may be desired by the user.The developer can write their library to run in a modifed executionenvironment like Cassette. This solution creates different contexts for multiple dispatch.A single developer can define their ambiguous methods only on concretesubtypes in Base, and provide utilities to extend these definitions. For example, Peter could define + on all concrete subtypes of Number in Base. In cases of ambiguity, + would then default to Jarrett\'s definition unless the user asks for Peter\'s definition.Hyperspecialize is designed to standardize and provide utilities for the latter approach."

He asks for his code to only be defined on the concrete subtypes of Number in Base. He uses the @concretize macro to define which subtypes of Number to use.  Now his definition looks like this:  @concretize myNumber [BigFloat, Float16, Float32, Float64, Bool, BigInt, Int128, Int16, Int32, Int64, Int8, UInt128, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64, UInt8]\n\n  @replicable Base.:+(p::PeterNumber, y::@hyperspecialize(myNumber)) = PeterNumber(p.x + y)Since Peter has only defined + for the concrete subtypes of Number, the user will need to ask for a specific definition of + for a type they would like to use. Consider what happens when Peter\'s package and Jarrett\'s package are loaded together.julia> friends = p + j\nJarrettNumber(PeterNumber(8.0))\n\njulia> using Hyperspecialize\n\njulia> @widen Peter.myNumber JarrettNumber\nSet(Type[BigInt, Bool, UInt32, Float64, Float32, Int64, Int128, Float16, JarrettNumber, UInt128, UInt8, UInt16, BigFloat, Int8, UInt64, Int16, Int32])\n\njulia> friends = p + j\nPeterNumber(JarrettNumber(8.0))Before the myNumber type tag in the Peter module is widened, there is no definition of + for PeterNumber and JarrettNumber in the Peter package, but since the Jarrett module defines a more generic method, that one is chosen. After the user widens Peter\'s definition to include a JarrettNumber (triggering a specific definition of + to be evaluated in Peter\'s module), the more specific method in Peter\'s package is chosen."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "There are three main drawbacks to the Hyperspecialize package.These macros may generate a very large number of definitions if thefunction definition includes many hyperspecialized type tags. For mathematical operators this can be alleviated using Julia\'s promotion rules, but the problem of how to define an unambiguous promote_type still stands. To further reduce the number of methods that are defined, in some situations it may be sufficient to only concretize the type tag to be a union of concrete types in Base. This strategy works best if it is unlikely that the method will be redefined using those types.The second drawback is that the user must manually choose desired behavior,so if the ambiguity is related to an internal type, the user may not know how to resolve it.The third drawback is that both methods that create an ambiguity may bedesired by a user, and they are forced to choose one global behavior. This can be problematic if a different library has widened the same type tag and made that choice for them already.In short, Hyperspecialize works best when the user knows which types are being concretized, and when the resolution to method ambiguities is clear. A major benefit to using Hyperspecialize is that you may keep your type-based API, you are not forced to adopt a function-based API. If this is not something that is important to you and you cannot work around difficulties involved in using Hyperspecialize, you will likely be better off using a contextual dispatch solution such as Cassette.<a name=\"promotetype\">1</a>: I have chosen + as an example function, but it would be possible to define promotion rules to avoid some ambiguities. However, it is possible that type ambiguities may occur in the definition of the `promotetype` function."
