% Here we show relation between variables used in the code to their 
% mathematical equivalent. Additional notes about code and maths.

Variables:

variable neq === L
variable cof === H
variable ultq === z

Functions:

function buildA: builds transition matrix


Maths:

sparse = 
	collapse a big matrix 

full = 
	explode a collapsed matrix

q =
	matrix used to keep track of the constraints already processed

A = 
	transition matrix
