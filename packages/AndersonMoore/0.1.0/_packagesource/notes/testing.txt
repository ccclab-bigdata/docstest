% Helpful tips for running tests

Need to add non registered packages in julia before you can use them.
Do this by git cloning, in julia we use the command Pkg.clone("url").
Get the "url" from "Clone or download" tab on your github remote repository.

Once cloned we can now add specific packages to working julia environment.
To do this use Pkg.add("registered name of package").

include("<filename>") === loads and runs a file in the environment
use("<filename>")     === loads a file in the environmentÂ 	
import("<filename>")  === similar to use
