    "text": "wiener(input, signal, noise[, blurring])The Wiener deconvolution attempts at reducing the noise in a digital signal by suppressing frequencies with low signal-to-noise ratio. The signal is assumed to be degraded by additive noise and a shift-invariant blurring function.The wiener function can be used to apply the Wiener deconvolution method to a digital signal.  The arguments are:input: the digital signal\nsignal: the original signal (or a signal with a luckily similar power spectrum)\nnoise: the noise of the signal (or a noise with a luckily similar power spectrum)\nblurring (optional argument): the blurring kernelAll arguments must be arrays, all with the same size, and all of them in the time/space domain (they will be converted to the frequency domain internally using fft function).  Argument noise can be also a real number, in which case a constant noise with that value will be assumed (this is a good approximation in the case of white noise)."
