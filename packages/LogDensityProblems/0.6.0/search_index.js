    "text": "TransformedLogDensity(transformation, logdensityfunction)\n\nA problem in Bayesian inference. Vectors of length dimension(transformation) are transformed into a general object θ (unrestricted type, but a named tuple is recommended for clean code), correcting for the log Jacobian determinant of the transformation.\n\nlogdensityfunction(θ) is expected to return real numbers. For zero densities or infeasible θs, -Inf or similar should be returned, but for efficiency of inference most methods recommend using transformation to avoid this.\n\nIt is recommended that logdensityfunction is a callable object that also encapsulates the data for the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
