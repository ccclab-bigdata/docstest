    "text": "(Image: Build Status)(Image: codecov.io)A Julia package for choosing resources (hardware, libraries, algorithms) for performing computations. It exports a set of types that allow you to dispatch to different methods depending on the selected resources. It also includes simple facilities that help package authors manage the loading of code in a way that depends on resource availability and user choice."

Instances of these types may optionally store additional settings that you can customize; for example you could define a TimeOut type:struct TimeOut\n    seconds::Float64\nendand then call some algorithm asoptimize(CPU1(TimeOut(3)), f, x)As a package author, you could write optimize to check for the timeout value and terminate early once this time has been exceeded."

    "text": "You can make the loading of code dependent upon the resources selected by the user.

Dummy.jl might start like this:module Dummy\n\nusing ComputationalResources\n\n# You need an __init__ function that will manage the loading of\n# sub-modules that implement specializations for different\n# computational resources\nfunction __init__()\n    # Enable `using` to load additional modules in this folder\n    push!(LOAD_PATH, dirname(@__FILE__))\n    # Now check for any resources that your package supports\n    if haveresource(ArrayFireLibs)\n        # User has indicated support for the ArrayFire libraries, so load your relevant code\n        @eval using DummyAF\n    end\n    # Put additional resource checks here\n    # Don\'t forget to clean up!\n    pop!(LOAD_PATH)\nend\n\n# Now define the methods you\'ll export, using single-threaded CPU\n# computations as the \"foundation\"\nfunction foo(resource::CPU1, args...)\n    # awesome algorithm goes here\nend\n\n# Typically you should select a default resource\nfoo(args...) = foo(CPU1(), args...)\n\nendYour DummyAF module is implemented in DummyAF.jl, which might look like this:module DummyAF\n\nusing ComputationalResources, Dummy, ArrayFire\n\nfunction Dummy.foo(resource::ArrayFireLibs, args...)\n    # specialization for the same computation, but using the ArrayFire libraries instead\nend\n\nendNote that the ArrayFire package was loaded by DummyAF but not by Dummy; as a consequence, users who do not have this package installed will not experience any errors. Assuming it\'s optional, you should not add ArrayFire to your package\'s REQUIRE file."
