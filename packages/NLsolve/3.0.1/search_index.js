    "text": "The NLsolve package solves systems of nonlinear equations. Formally, if F is a multivalued function, then this package looks for some vector x that satisfies F(x)=0 to some accuracy.The package is also able to solve mixed complementarity problems, which are similar to systems of nonlinear equations, except that the equality to zero is allowed to become an inequality if some boundary condition is satisfied. See further below for a formal definition and the related commands.There is also an identical API for solving fixed points (i.e., taking as input a function F(x), and solving F(x) = x)."

    "text": "We consider the following bivariate function of two variables:(x, y) -> ((x+3)*(y^3-7)+18, sin(y*exp(x)-1))In order to find a zero of this function and display it, you would write the following program:using NLsolve\n\nfunction f!(F, x)\n    F[1] = (x[1]+3)*(x[2]^3-7)+18\n    F[2] = sin(x[2]*exp(x[1])-1)\nend\n\nfunction j!(J, x)\n    J[1, 1] = x[2]^3-7\n    J[1, 2] = 3*x[2]^2*(x[1]+3)\n    u = exp(x[1])*cos(x[2]*exp(x[1])-1)\n    J[2, 1] = x[2]*u\n    J[2, 2] = u\nend\n\nnlsolve(f!, j!, [ 0.1; 1.2])First, note that the function f! computes the residuals of the nonlinear system, and stores them in a preallocated vector passed as first argument. Similarly, the function j! computes the Jacobian of the system and stores it in a preallocated matrix passed as first argument. Residuals and Jacobian functions can take different shapes, see below.Second, when calling the nlsolve function, it is necessary to give a starting point to the iterative algorithm.Finally, the nlsolve function returns an object of type SolverResults. In particular, the field zero of that structure contains the solution if convergence has occurred. If r is an object of type SolverResults, then converged(r) indicates if convergence has occurred."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "If the Jacobian of your function is sparse, it is possible to ask the routines to manipulate sparse matrices instead of full ones, in order to increase performance on large systems. This means that we must necessarily provide an appropriate Jacobian type so the solver knows what to feed j!.df = OnceDifferentiable(f!, j!, x0, F0, J0)\nnlsolve(df, initial_x)It is possible to give an optional third function fj! to the constructor, as for the full Jacobian case.Note that the Jacobian matrix is not reset across function calls. As a result, you need to be careful and ensure that you don\'t forget to overwrite all nonzeros elements that could have been initialized by a previous function call. If in doubt, you can clear the sparse matrix at the beginning of the function. If J is the sparse Jacobian, this can be achieved with:fill!(a, 0)\ndropzeros!(a) # if you also want to remove the sparsity pattern"

It does not use Jacobian information or linesearch, but has a history whose size is controlled by the m parameter: m=0 (the default) corresponds to the simple fixed-point iteration above, and higher values use a larger history size to accelerate the iterations. Higher values of m usually increase the speed of convergence, but increase the storage and computation requirements and might lead to instabilities. This method is useful to accelerate a fixed-point iteration xₙ₊₁ = g(xₙ) (in which case use this solver with f(x) = g(x) - x).Reference: H. Walker, P. Ni, Anderson acceleration for fixed-point iterations, SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis, 2011"

This allows convenient solution of fixed-point problems, e.g. of the kind commonly encountered in computational economics. Some notes:The default method is :anderson with m = 5. Naive \"Picard\"-style iteration can be achieved by setting m=0, but that isn\'t advisable for contractions whose Lipschitz constants are close to 1. If convergence fails, though, you may consider lowering it.\nAutodifferentiation is supported; e.g. fixedpoint(f!, init_x; method = :newton, autodiff = :true).\nTolerances and iteration bounds can be set exactly as in nlsolve(), since this function is a wrapper, e.g. fixedpoint(f, init_x; iterations = 500, ...).Note: If you are supplying your own derivative, make sure that it is appropriately transformed (i.e., we currently map f -> f - x, but are waiting on the API to stabilize before mapping J -> J - I, so you\'ll need to do that yourself.)"

    "text": "Given a multivariate function f and two vectors a and b, the solution to the mixed complementarity problem (MCP) is a vector x such that one of the following holds for every index i:either f_i(x) = 0 and a_i <= x_i <= b_i\nor f_i(x) > 0 and x_i = a_i\nor f_i(x) < 0 and x_i = b_iThe vector a can contain elements equal to -Inf, while the vector b can contain elements equal to Inf. In the particular case where all elements of a are equal to -Inf, and all elements of b are equal to Inf, the MCP is exactly equivalent to the multivariate root finding problem described above.The package solves MCPs by reformulating them as the solution to a system of nonlinear equations (as described by Miranda and Fackler, 2002, though NLsolve uses the sign convention opposite to theirs).The function mcpsolve solves MCPs. It takes the same arguments as nlsolve, except that the vectors a and b must immediately follow the argument(s) corresponding to f (and possibly its derivative). There is also an extra optional argument reformulation, which can take two values:reformulation = :smooth: use a smooth reformulation of the problem using the Fischer function. This is the default, since it is more robust for complex problems.\nreformulation = :minmax: use a min-max reformulation of the problem. It is faster than the smooth approximation, since it uses less algebra, but is less robust since the reformulated problem has kinks.Here is a complete example:using NLsolve\n\nfunction f!(F, x)\n    F[1]=3*x[1]^2+2*x[1]*x[2]+2*x[2]^2+x[3]+3*x[4]-6\n    F[2]=2*x[1]^2+x[1]+x[2]^2+3*x[3]+2*x[4]-2\n    F[3]=3*x[1]^2+x[1]*x[2]+2*x[2]^2+2*x[3]+3*x[4]-1\n    F[4]=x[1]^2+3*x[2]^2+2*x[3]+3*x[4]-3\nend\n\nr = mcpsolve(f!, [0., 0., 0., 0.], [Inf, Inf, Inf, Inf],\n             [1.25, 0., 0., 0.5], reformulation = :smooth, autodiff = :forward)The solution is:julia> r.zero\n4-element Array{Float64,1}:\n  1.22474\n  0.0\n -1.378e-19\n  0.5The lower bounds are hit for the second and third components, hence the second and third components of the function are positive at the solution.
