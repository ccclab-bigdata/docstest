    "text": "Geostatistics (a.k.a. spatial statistics) is the branch of statistics that deals with spatial data. In many fields of science, such as mining engineering, hidrogeology, petroleum engineering, and environmental sciences, traditional regression techniques fail to capture spatiotemporal correlation, and therefore are not satisfactory tools for decision making involving spatial resources.GeoStats.jl is an attempt to bring together bleeding-edge research in the geostatistics community into a comprehensive framework, and to empower researchers and practioners with a toolkit for fast assessment of different modeling approaches.The design of this package is the result of many years developing geostatistical software. I hope that it can serve to promote more collaboration between geostatisticians around the globe and to standardize this incredible science.If you would like to help support the project, please star the repository on GitHub and share it with your colleagues. If you are a developer, please check GeoStatsBase.jl and GeoStatsDevTools.jl."

    "text": "One of the greatest features of GeoStats.jl is the ability to define geostatistical problems independently of the solution strategy. This design allows researchers and practioners to perform fair comparisons between different solvers. It is perhaps the single most important contribution of this project.If you are an experienced user of geostatistics or if you do research in the field, you know how hard it is to compare algorithms fairly. Often a new algorithm is proposed in the literature, and yet the task of comparing it with the state of the art is quite demanding. Even when a comparison is made by the author after a great amount of effort, it is inevitably biased.Part of this issue is attributed to the fact that a general definition of the problem is missing. What is it that we call an \"estimation problem\" in geostatistics? What about \"stochastic simulation\"? The answer to these questions is given below in the form of code."

    "text": "newcommandxboldsymbolx\nnewcommandRmathbbR\nnewcommand1mathbb1In an intrinsic isotropic model, the variogram is only a function of the distance between any two points x_1x_2 in R^m:gamma(x_1x_2) = gamma(x_1 - x_2) = gamma(h)Under the additional assumption of 2nd-order stationarity, the well-known covariance is directly related via gamma(h) = cov(0) - cov(h). Anisotropic models are easily obtained by defining an ellipsoid distance in place of the Euclidean distance. For a list of available distances, please see Distances.jl.This package implements a few commonly used and other more excentric variogram models. They all share the same default parameters:sill=1\nrange=1\nnugget=0\ndistance=Euclidean()Some of them have extra parameters that can be set with keyword arguments:GaussianVariogram(nugget=.1) # set nugget effect\nMaternVariogram(order=1) # set order of Bessel functionAdditionally, a composite (additive) variogram model gamma(h) = gamma_1(h) + gamma_2(h) + cdots gamma_n(h) can be constructed from a list of variogram models:γ = GaussianVariogram() + ExponentialVariogram()Like the other variogram models, a composite variogram gamma can be evaluated as an isotropic model gamma(h) or as a model with a custom distance gamma(x_1x_2).Finally, the 2nd-order stationarity property of a variogram can be checked with the isstationary method:isstationary"
