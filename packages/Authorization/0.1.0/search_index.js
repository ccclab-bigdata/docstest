    "category": "section",
    "text": "A client\'s access to a resource is determined by its Permission for the resource. The Permission type is defined as:struct Permission\n    create::Bool\n    read::Bool\n    update::Bool\n    delete::Bool\n    expiry::DateTime\nendPermissions created without an expiry are given an (almost) infinite expiry.A client can loosely be thought of as a mapping from resources to Permissions.More precisely, the mapping is a hierarchy of 3 maps.As we move up the hierarchy:Each level maps a smaller set of resources to permissions than the previous level.\nThe permissions override those specified at the previous level.The levels are:At the bottom of the hierarchy is the map from resource type to permission. This allows the same permission to be applied to all resources with the same type. For example a client may have read-only access to the entire local system. In this case the resources are directories and files and the associated permission is Permission(false, true, false, false, expiry).\nIn the middle of the hierarchy is the map from resource ID pattern (Regexs) to permission. This mapping overrides the permissions specified in the type-to-permission mapping. Continuing our file system example, the same client could also have write access to a particular directory using this mapping.\nAt the top of the hierarchy is the map from resource ID to permission. This mapping allows access control for specific resources.This framework allows both fine-grained and somewhat coarse access control within the same client, provided the permissions don\'t conflict within a level of the hierarchy (test for conflicts via permissions_conflict(client, resourceid)).Here\'s a quick sample of the API:# Allow cRud (read-only) access without expiry to resources with type resource_type\nsetpermission!(client, resource_type, Permission(false, true, false, false))\n\n# Allow CRUD (read/write) access for 5 minutes to resources with IDs starting with \"mycollection/\"\nsetpermission!(client, r\"mycollection/*\", Permission(true, true, true, true, now() + Minute(5)))\n\np = getpermission(client, resource)  # Get the permission settings for the specific resource\nsetexpiry!(client, now() + Hour(1))  # Set an expiry for all the resources that the client has access to\n\nhaspermission(client, resource, :create)    # True if the client has :create access to the resource\npermissions_conflict(client, \"myresource\")  # True if the rules that define the client\'s access to the resource with ID \"myresource\" conflict"

Each works as follows:Check whether the client has permission to act on the resource.\nIf so, act on the resource.\nIf all is well, return nothing when creating/updating/deleting, and return (true, value) when reading\nElse return an error message when creating/updating/deleting, and return (false, error message) when reading\nElse return an error message when creating/updating/deleting, and return (false, error message) when reading"

    "text": "Authorization.jl can be used to implement web-app sessions.Suppose a user\'s access is determined by his/her subscription to an app. Then, for example, setpermission!(client, App, permission) sets permissions for all resources related to the app with type App. Also, setexpiry(client, expiry) can be used to set an expiry on all resources to which the client has access. The client can then be used as the session object. When a request comes in, the client and requested resource can be identified from the request (and perhaps server state). Determining whether the client has permission to access the resource is then a matter of calling haspermission."
