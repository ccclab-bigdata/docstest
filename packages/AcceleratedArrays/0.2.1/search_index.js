    "text": "Arrays with acceleration indices.(Image: Build Status) (Image: Build status) (Image: codecov)AcceleratedArrays provides (seconday) acceleration indexes for Julia AbstractArrays. Such acceleration indexes can be used to speed up certain operations, particularly those involving searching through the values - for example, an AcceleratedArray may have more efficient implementations of functions such as findall, filter, and unique.As a general rule, this package has been implemented for the purposes of accelerating analytics workloads and is designed to support functional, non-mutating workflows. It is currently not supported to add an index to data you expect to mutate afterwards."

For example, the hash map will let us find a certain element without exhaustively searching the array, or we can easily find all the elements within a given interval with a sorted array.# Find the index of \"Bob\" in `a`\nfindall(isequal(\"Bob\"), a)\n\n# Return all the numbers in `b` between 40 and 60\nfilter(in(40..60), b)"

    "text": "In Julia, sorting is (typically) achieved using the isless and isequal predicates, which are designed to provide a canonical total order for values. Currently, the acceleration indices rely on these rather than the comparison operators ==, <, <=, >, >= and !=.To make life easier, this package introduces a number of new convenience functions:islessequal(a, b) = isless(a, b) || isequal(a, b)\nisgreater(a, b) = isless(b, a)\nisgreaterequal(a, b) = isless(b, a) || isequal(a, b)Any of these support \"currying\", which is a simple syntax for creating a closure such as isequal(a) = (b -> isequal(a, b)). Such curried predicates are picked up by multiple dispatch to accelerate operations like findall(isequal(3.0), accelerated_array)."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "It is common to want to search for all values in a range. This package introduces an Interval type to represent the set of of values between two endpoints (with respect to isless and isequal).An interval is easily created with the .. operator via the syntax a .. b. To find if a value is in this range, use the in function/operator (alternatively spelled ∈, which can be inserted at the REPL via \\in <TAB>). For example, 3 ∈ 0 .. 10 is true but 13 ∈ 0 .. 10 is false.By default, an interval is inclusive of its endpoints, such that 10 ∈ 0 .. 10. An endpoint can be excluded via the lessthan or greaterthan function, which returns a value almost equal to but slightly less/greater than its input. An interval exclusive of both its endpoints can be expressed as greaterthan(a) .. lessthan(b). For example 10 ∉ 0 .. lessthan(10)."
