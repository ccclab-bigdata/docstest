    "text": "The package is available for Julia versions 0.6 and up. To install it, runPkg.add(\"FFTW\")from the Julia REPL.Users with a build of Julia based on Intel\'s Math Kernel Library (MKL) can take use MKL for FFTs by setting an environment variable JULIA_FFTW_PROVIDER to MKL and running Pkg.build(\"FFTW\"). Setting this environment variable only needs to be done for the first build of the package; after that, the package will remember to use MKL when building and updating. Note however that MKL provides only a subset of the functionality provided by FFTW. See Intel\'s documentation for more information about potential differences or gaps in functionality."

The kind argument may be an array or tuple in order to specify different transform types along the different dimensions of A; kind[end] is used for any unspecified dimensions.  See the FFTW manual for precise definitions of these transform types, at http://www.fftw.org/doc.\n\nThe optional dims argument specifies an iterable subset of dimensions (e.g. an integer, range, tuple, or array) to transform along. kind[i] is then the transform type for dims[i], with kind[end] being used for i > length(kind).\n\nSee also plan_r2r to pre-plan optimized r2r transforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
