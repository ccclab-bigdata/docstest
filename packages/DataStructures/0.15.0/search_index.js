However, the Deque type in this package is implemented as a list of contiguous blocks (default size = 2K). As a deque grows, new blocks may be created and linked to existing blocks. This way avoids the copying when growing a vector.Benchmark shows that the performance of Deque is comparable to Vector on push!, and is noticeably faster on unshift! (by about 30% to 40%)."

    "text": "CurrentModule = DataStructuresThree sorted containers are provided: SortedDict, SortedMultiDict and SortedSet. SortedDict is similar to the built-in Julia type Dict with the additional feature that the keys are stored in sorted order and can be efficiently iterated in this order. SortedDict is a subtype of AbstractDict. It is generally slower than Dict because looking up a key requires an O(log n) tree search rather than an expected O(1) hash-table lookup time as with Dict. SortedDict is a parametrized type with three parameters, the key type K, the value type V, and the ordering type O. SortedSet has only keys; it is an alternative to the built-in Set container. Internally, SortedSet is implemented as a SortedDict in which the value type is Void. Finally, SortedMultiDict is similar to SortedDict except that each key can be associated with multiple values. The key=>value pairs in a SortedMultiDict are stored according to the sorted order for keys, and key=>value pairs with the same key are stored in order of insertion.The containers internally use a 2-3 tree, which is a kind of balanced tree and is described in many elementary data structure textbooks.The containers require two functions to compare keys: a less-than and equals function. With the default ordering argument, the comparison functions are isless(key1,key2) (true when key1 < key2) and isequal(key1,key2) (true when key1 == key2) where key1 and key2 are keys. More details are provided below."

    "page": "Sorted Containers",
    "title": "Tokens for Sorted Containers",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "The sorted container objects use a special type for indexing called a token defined as a two-entry tuple and aliased as SDToken, SMDToken, and SetToken for SortedDict, SortedMultiDict and SortedSet respectively. A token is the address of a single data item in the container and can be dereferenced in time O(1).The first entry of a Token tuple is the container as a whole, and the second refers to the particular item. The second part is called a semitoken. The types for a semitoken are SDSemiToken, SMDSemiToken, and SetSemiToken for the three types of containers SortedDict, SortedMultiDict and SortedSet. These types are all aliases of IntSemiToken.A restriction for the sorted containers is that IntSemiToken or its aliases cannot used as the key-type. This is because ambiguity would result between the two subscripting calls sc[k] and sc[st] described below. In the rare scenario that a sorted container whose key-type is IntSemiToken is required, a workaround is to wrap the key inside another immutable structure.In the current version of Julia, it is costly to operate on tuples whose entries are not bits-types because such tuples are allocated on the heap. For example, the first entry of a token is a pointer to a container (a non-bits type), so a new token is allocated on the heap rather than the stack. In order to avoid performance loss, the package uses tokens less frequently than semitokens. For a function taking a token as an argument like deref described below, if it is invoked by explicitly naming the token like this:tok = (sc,st)   # sc is a sorted container, st is a semitoken\nk,v = deref(tok)then there may be a loss of performance compared to:k,v = deref((sc,st))because the former may need an extra heap allocation step for tok.The notion of token is similar to the concept of iterators used by C++ standard containers. Tokens can be explicitly advanced or regressed through the data in the sorted order; they are implicitly advanced or regressed via iteration loops defined below.A token may take two special values: the before-start value and the past-end value. These values act as lower and upper bounds on the actual data. The before-start token can be advanced, while the past-end token can be regressed. A dereferencing operation on either leads to an error.In the current implementation, semitokens are internally stored as integers. However, for the purpose of future compatibility, the user should not extract this internal representation; these integers do not have a documented interpretation in terms of the container."

    "title": "Iteration Over Sorted Containers",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "As is standard in Julia, iteration over the containers is implemented via calls to the iterate function. It is usual practice, however, to call this function implicitly with a for-loop rather than explicitly, so they are presented here in for-loop notation. Internally, all of these iterations are implemented with semitokens that are advanced via the advance operation. Each iteration of these loops requires O(log n) operations to advance the semitoken. If one loops over an entire container, then the amortized cost of advancing the semitoken drops to O(1).The following snippet loops over the entire container sc, where sc is a SortedDict or SortedMultiDict:for (k,v) in sc\n   < body >\nendIn this loop, (k,v) takes on successive (key,value) pairs according to the sort order of the key. If one uses:for p in sc\n   < body >\nendwhere sc is a SortedDict or SortedMultiDict, then p is a k=>v pair.For SortedSet one uses:for k in ss\n   < body >\nendThere are two ways to iterate over a subrange of a container. The first is the inclusive iteration for SortedDict and SortedMultiDict:for (k,v) in inclusive(sc,st1,st2)\n  < body >\nendHere, st1 and st2 are semitokens that refer to the container sc. Token (sc,st1) may not be the before-start token and token (sc,st2) may not be the past-end token.  It is acceptable for (sc,st1) to be the past-end token or (sc,st2) to be the before-start token or both (in these cases, the body is not executed). If compare(sc,st1,st2)==1 then the body is not executed. A second calling format for inclusive is inclusive(sc,(st1,st2)). With the second format, the return value of searchequalrange may be used directly as the second argument to inclusive.One can also define a loop that excludes the final item:for (k,v) in exclusive(sc,st1,st2)\n  < body >\nendIn this case, all the data addressed by tokens from (sc,st1) up to but excluding (sc,st2) are executed. The body is not executed at all if compare(sc,st1,st2)>=0. In this setting, either or both can be the past-end token, and (sc,st2) can be the before-start token. For the sake of consistency, exclusive also supports the calling format exclusive(sc,(st1,st2)). In the previous few snippets, if the loop object is p instead of (k,v), then p is a k=>v pair.Both the inclusive and exclusive functions return objects that can be saved and used later for iteration. The validity of the tokens is not checked until the loop initiates.For SortedSet the usage is:for k in inclusive(ss,st1,st2)\n  < body >\nend\n\nfor k in exclusive(ss,st1,st2)\n  < body >\nendIf sc is a SortedDict or SortedMultiDict, one can iterate over just keys or just values:for k in keys(sc)\n   < body >\nend\n\nfor v in values(sc)\n   < body >\nendFinally, one can retrieve semitokens during any of these iterations. In the case of SortedDict and SortedMultiDict, one uses:for (st,k,v) in semitokens(sc)\n    < body >\nend\n\nfor (st,k) in semitokens(keys(sc))\n    < body >\nend\n\nfor (st,v) in semitokens(values(sc))\n    < body >\nendIn each of the above three iterations, st is a semitoken referring to the current (k,v) pair. In the case of SortedSet, the following iteration may be used:for (st,k) in semitokens(ss)\n    < body >\nendIf one wishes to retrieve only semitokens, the following may be used:for st in onlysemitokens(sc)\n    < body >\nendIn this case, sc is a SortedDict, SortedMultiDict, or SortedSet. To be compatible with standard containers, the package also offers eachindex iteration:for ind in eachindex(sc)\n    < body >\nendThis iteration function eachindex is equivalent to keys in the case of SortedDict. It is equivalent to onlysemitokens in the case of SortedMultiDict and SortedSet.In place of sc in the above keys, values and semitokens, snippets, one could also use inclusive(sc,st1,st2) or exclusive(sc,st1,st2). Similarly, for SortedSet, one can iterate over semitokens(inclusive(ss,st1,st2)) or semitokens(exclusive(ss,st1,st2))Note that it is acceptable for the loop body in the above semitokens code snippets to invoke delete!((sc,st)) or delete!((ss,st)). This is because the for-loop internal state variable is already advanced to the next token at the beginning of the body, so st is not necessarily referred to in the loop body (unless the user refers to it)."

For example, the call:(k=>v) in exclusive(sd, st1, st2)where sd is a SortedDict, st1 and st2 are semitokens, k is a key, and v is a value, will loop over all entries in the dictionary between the two tokens and a compare for equality using isequal between the indexed item and k=>v.The five exceptions are:(k=>v) in sd\n(k=>v) in smd\nk in ss\nk in keys(sd)\nk in keys(smd)Here, sd is a SortedDict, smd is a SortedMultiDict, and ss is a SortedSet.These five invocations of in use the index structure of the sorted container and test equality based on the order object of the keys rather than isequal.

Note: this is the name of the ordering object; its type is ForwardOrdering. Another possible ordering object is Reverse, which reverses the usual sorted order. This name must be imported import Base.Reverse if it is used.As an example of a custom ordering, suppose the keys are of type String, and the user wishes to order the keys ignoring case: APPLE, berry and Cherry would appear in that order, and APPLE and aPPlE would be indistinguishable in this ordering.The simplest approach is to define an ordering object of the form Lt(my_isless), where Lt is a built-in type (see ordering.jl) and my_isless is the user\'s comparison function. In the above example, the ordering object would be:Lt((x,y) -> isless(lowercase(x),lowercase(y)))The ordering object is indicated in the above list of constructors in the o position (see above for constructor syntax).This approach may suffer from a performance hit because higher performance  may be possible if an equality method is also available as well as a less-than method. A more complicated but higher-performance method to implement a custom ordering is as follows. First, the user creates a singleton type that is a subtype of Ordering as follows:struct CaseInsensitive <: Ordering\nendNext, the user defines a method named lt for less-than in this ordering:lt(::CaseInsensitive, a, b) = isless(lowercase(a), lowercase(b))The first argument to lt is an object of the CaseInsensitive type (there is only one such object since it is a singleton type). The container also needs an equal-to function; the default is:eq(o::Ordering, a, b) = !lt(o, a, b) && !lt(o, b, a)The user can also customize this function with a more efficient implementation. In the above example, an appropriate customization would be:eq(::CaseInsensitive, a, b) = isequal(lowercase(a), lowercase(b))Finally, the user specifies the unique element of CaseInsensitive, namely the object CaseInsensitive(), as the ordering object to the SortedDict, SortedMultiDict or SortedSet constructor.For the above code to work, the module must make the following declarations, typically near the beginning:import Base.Ordering\nimport Base.lt\nimport DataStructures.eq"

    "text": "As with ordinary Dicts, keys for the sorted containers can be either mutable or immutable. In the case of mutable keys, it is important that the keys not be mutated once they are in the container else the indexing structure will be corrupted. (The same restriction applies to Dict.) For example, suppose a SortedDict sd is defined in which the keys are of type Array{Int,1}. (For this to be possible, the user must provide an isless function or order object for Array{Int,1} since none is built into Julia.) Suppose the values of sd are of type Int. Then the following sequence of statements leaves sd in a corrupted state:k = [1,2,3]\nsd[k] = 19\nk[1] = 7"

    "text": "The sorted containers are currently not optimized for cache performance. This will be addressed in the future.There is a minor performance issue as follows: the container may hold onto a small number of keys and values even after the data records containing those keys and values have been deleted. This may cause a memory drain in the case of large keys and values. It may also lead to a delay in the invocation of finalizers. All keys and values are released completely by the empty! function."
