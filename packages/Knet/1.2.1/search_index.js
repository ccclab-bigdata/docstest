    "text": "For best results install (1) a host compiler, (2) GPU support, (3) Julia, and (4) Knet in that order. Step (1) can be skipped if you do not need convolutions. Step (2) can be skipped if you do not have a GPU.Host compiler: On Linux, the gcc compiler that comes standard with all distributions is supported.  On Mac you need to install Xcode which provides the clang compiler.  On Windows you need the Visual C++ compiler which comes with Visual Studio or Build Tools (I have tested with VS 2015 because VS 2017 was not supported by the CUDA toolkit as of December 10, 2017).  If you don\'t have a compiler, most of Knet will still work on CPU (slow).GPU support: If your machine has an NVIDIA GPU, Knet will automatically discover it and compile support code if you have the required host compiler, driver, toolkit and cuDNN library pre-installed. Knet uses the CUDAapi library for discovery.Julia: Download and install the latest version of Julia from julialang.org. As of this writing the latest version is 1.0.0 and I have tested Knet using 64-bit Generic Linux binaries, the macOS package (10.8+ 64-bit dmg), and 64-bit Windows Self Extracting Archive (exe).

I have prepared a machine image (AMI) with everything you need to run Knet. Here are step by step instructions for launching a GPU instance with a Knet image (the screens may have changed slightly since this writing):1. First, you need to sign up and create an account following the instructions on Setting Up with Amazon EC2. Once you have an account, open the Amazon EC2 console and login. You should see the following screen:(Image: image)2. Make sure you select the \"Ohio\" region in the upper right corner, then click on AMIs on the lower left menu. At the search box, choose \"Public images\" and search for \"Knet\". Click on the latest Knet image (Knet-1.0.0 as of this writing). You should see the following screen with information about the Knet AMI. Click on the \"Launch\" button on the upper left.(Image: image)Note: Instead of \"Launch\", you may want to experiment with \"Spot Request\" under \"Actions\" to get a lower price. You may also qualify for an educational grant if you are a student or researcher.3. You should see the \"Step 2: Choose an Instance Type\" page. Pick one of the GPU instances (I have tested with the g2 series and the p2 series). Click on \"Review and Launch\".(Image: image)4. This should take you to the \"Step 7: Review Instance Launch\" page. You can just click \"Launch\" here:(Image: image)5. You should see the \"key pair\" pop up menu. In order to login to your instance, you need an ssh key pair. If you have created a pair during the initial setup you can use it with \"Choose an existing key pair\". Otherwise pick \"Create a new key pair\" from the pull down menu, enter a name for it, and click \"Download Key Pair\". Make sure you keep the downloaded file, we will use it to login. After making sure you have the key file (it has a .pem extension), click \"Launch Instances\" on the lower right.(Image: image)6. We have completed the request. You should see the \"Launch Status\" page. Click on your instance id under \"Your instances are launching\":(Image: image)7.

    "text": "Knet uses dynamic computational graphs generated at runtime for automatic differentiation of (almost) any Julia code.  This allows machine learning models to be implemented by defining just the forward calculation (i.e. the computation from parameters and data to loss) using the full power and expressivity of Julia. The implementation can use helper functions, loops, conditionals, recursion, closures, tuples and dictionaries, array indexing, concatenation and other high level language features, some of which are often missing in the restricted modeling languages of static computational graph systems like Theano, Torch, Caffe and Tensorflow.  GPU operation is supported by simply using the KnetArray type instead of regular Array for parameters and data.Knet builds a dynamic computational graph by recording primitive operations during forward calculation.  Only pointers to inputs and outputs are recorded for efficiency.  Therefore array overwriting is not supported during forward and backward passes.  This encourages a clean functional programming style.  High performance is achieved using custom memory management and efficient GPU kernels.  See Under the hood for more details."

    "text": "GPUs have become indispensable for training large deep learning models.  Even the small examples implemented here run up to 17x faster on the GPU compared to the 8 core CPU architecture we use for benchmarking. However GPU implementations have a few potential pitfalls: (i) GPU memory allocation is slow, (ii) GPU-RAM memory transfer is slow, (iii) reduction operations (like sum) can be very slow unless implemented properly (See Optimizing Parallel Reduction in CUDA).Knet implements KnetArray as a Julia data type that wraps GPU array pointers. KnetArray is based on the more standard CudaArray with a few important differences: (i) KnetArrays have a custom memory manager, similar to ArrayFire, which reuse pointers garbage collected by Julia to reduce the number of GPU memory allocations, (ii) contiguous array ranges (e.g. a[:,3:5]) are handled as views with shared pointers instead of copies when possible, and (iii) a number of custom CUDA kernels written for KnetArrays implement element-wise, broadcasting, and scalar and vector reduction operations efficiently. As a result Knet allows users to implement their models using high-level code, yet be competitive in performance with other frameworks as demonstrated in the benchmarks section. Other GPU related Julia packages can be found in JuliaGPU."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "As we have seen, many common machine learning models can be expressed as differentiable programs that input parameters and data and output a scalar loss value. The loss value measures how close the model predictions are to desired values with the given parameters. Training a model can then be seen as an optimization problem: find the parameters that minimize the loss. Typically, a gradient based optimization algorithm is used for computational efficiency: the direction in the parameter space in which the loss reduction is maximum is given by the negative gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters. Thus gradient computations take a central stage in software frameworks for machine learning. In this section I will briefly outline existing gradient computation techniques and motivate the particular approach taken by Knet.Computation of gradients in computer models is performed by four main methods (Baydin et al. 2015):manual differentiation (programming the derivatives)\nnumerical differentiation (using finite difference approximations)\nsymbolic differentiation (using expression manipulation)\nautomatic differentiation (detailed below)Manually taking derivatives and coding the result is labor intensive, error-prone, and all but impossible with complex deep learning models.  Numerical differentiation is simple: f(x)=(f(x+epsilon)-f(x-epsilon))(2epsilon) but impractical: the finite difference equation needs to be evaluated for each individual parameter, of which there are typically many. Pure symbolic differentiation using expression manipulation, as implemented in software such as Maxima, Maple, and Mathematica is impractical for different reasons: (i) it may not be feasible to express a machine learning model as a closed form mathematical expression, and (ii) the symbolic derivative can be exponentially larger than the model itself leading to inefficient run-time calculation. This leaves us with automatic differentiation.Automatic differentiation is the idea of using symbolic derivatives only at the level of elementary operations, and computing the gradient of a compound function by applying the chain rule to intermediate numerical results. For example, pure symbolic differentiation of sin^2(x) could give us 2sin(x)cos(x) directly. Automatic differentiation would use the intermediate numerical values x_1=sin(x), x_2=x_1^2 and the elementary derivatives dx_2dx_1=2x_1, dx_1dx=cos(x) to compute the same answer without ever building a full gradient expression.To implement automatic differentiation the target function needs to be decomposed into its elementary operations, a process similar to compilation. Most older machine learning frameworks (such as Theano, Torch, Caffe, Tensorflow and older versions of Knet prior to v0.8) compile models expressed in a restricted mini-language into a static computational graph of elementary operations that have pre-defined derivatives. There are two drawbacks with this approach: (i) the restricted mini-languages tend to have limited support for high-level language features such as conditionals, loops, helper functions, array indexing, etc. (e.g. the infamous scan operation in Theano) (ii) the sequence of elementary operations that unfold at run-time needs to be known in advance, and they are difficult to handle when the sequence is data dependent.There is an alternative: high-level languages, like Julia and Python, already know how to decompose functions into their elementary operations. If we let the users define their models directly in a high-level language, then record the elementary operations during loss calculation at run-time, a dynamic computational graph can be constructed from the recorded operations. The cost of recording is not prohibitive: The table below gives cumulative times for elementary operations of an MLP with quadratic loss. Recording only adds 15% to the raw cost of the forward computation. Backpropagation roughly doubles the total time as expected.op secs\na1=w1*x 0.67\na2=w2.+a1 0.71\na3=max.(0,a2) 0.75\na4=w3*a3 0.81\na5=w4.+a4 0.85\na6=a5-y 0.89\na7=sum(abs2,a6) 1.18\n+recording 1.33\n+backprop 2.79This is the approach taken by the popular autograd Python package and its Julia port AutoGrad.jl used by Knet. Recently, other machine learning frameworks have been adapting dynamic computational graphs: Chainer, DyNet, PyTorch, TensorFlow Fold. Related Julia projects include Flux and JuliaDiff.In AutoGrad, parameters of interest are boxed by the Param type. y = @diff f(x) returns a struct such that value(y) gives f(x) (which should be a scalar), params(y) gives the list of parameters that took place in the computation of f(x), and grad(y,p) gives the gradient of f(x) with respect to parameter p.  In a @diff context, the elementary operations in f are overloaded to record their actions and output boxed answers when their inputs are boxed. The sequence of recorded operations is then used to compute gradients. Derivatives can be defined independently for each method of a function (determined by argument types) making full use of Julia\'s multiple dispatch. New elementary operations and derivatives can be defined concisely using Julia\'s macro and meta-programming facilities. See AutoGrad.jl for details."

    "text": "KnetArray{T}(undef,dims)\nKnetArray(a::AbstractArray)\nArray(k::KnetArray)\n\nContainer for GPU arrays that supports most of the AbstractArray interface.  The constructor allocates a KnetArray in the currently active device, as specified by gpu().  KnetArrays and Arrays can be converted to each other as shown above, which involves copying to and from the GPU memory.  Only Float32/64 KnetArrays are fully supported.\n\nImportant differences from the alternative CudaArray are: (1) a custom memory manager that minimizes the number of calls to the slow cudaMalloc by reusing already allocated but garbage collected GPU pointers.  (2) a custom getindex that handles ranges such as a[5:10] as views with shared memory instead of copies.  (3) custom CUDA kernels that implement elementwise, broadcasting, and reduction operations.\n\nSupported functions:\n\nIndexing: getindex, setindex! with the following index types:\n1-D: Real, Colon, OrdinalRange, AbstractArray{Real}, AbstractArray{Bool}, CartesianIndex, AbstractArray{CartesianIndex}, EmptyArray, KnetArray{Int32} (low level), KnetArray{0/1} (using float for BitArray) (1-D includes linear indexing of multidimensional arrays)\n2-D: (Colon,Union{Real,Colon,OrdinalRange,AbstractVector{Real},AbstractVector{Bool},KnetVector{Int32}}), (Union{Real,AbstractUnitRange,Colon}...) (in any order)\nN-D: (Real...)\nArray operations: ==, !=, cat, convert, copy, copyto!, deepcopy, display, eachindex, eltype, endof, fill!, first, hcat, isapprox, isempty, length, ndims, one, ones, pointer, rand!, randn!, reshape, similar, size, stride, strides, summary, vcat, vec, zero. (cat(x,y,dims=i) supported for i=1,2.)\nMath operators: (-), abs, abs2, acos, acosh, asin, asinh, atan, atanh, cbrt, ceil, cos, cosh, cospi, erf, erfc, erfcinv, erfcx, erfinv, exp, exp10, exp2, expm1, floor, log, log10, log1p, log2, round, sign, sin, sinh, sinpi, sqrt, tan, tanh, trunc\nBroadcasting operators: (.*), (.+), (.-), (./), (.<), (.<=), (.!=), (.==), (.>), (.>=), (.^), max, min.  (Boolean operators generate outputs with same type as inputs; no support for KnetArray{Bool}.)\nReduction operators: countnz, maximum, mean, minimum, prod, sum, sumabs, sumabs2, norm.\nLinear algebra: (*), axpy!, permutedims (up to 5D), transpose\nKnet extras: relu, sigm, invx, logp, logsumexp, conv4, pool, deconv4, unpool, mat, update! (Only 4D/5D, Float32/64 KnetArrays support conv4, pool, deconv4, unpool)\n\nMemory management\n\nKnet models do not overwrite arrays which need to be preserved for gradient calculation.  This leads to a lot of allocation and regular GPU memory allocation is prohibitively slow. Fortunately most models use identically sized arrays over and over again, so we can minimize the number of actual allocations by reusing preallocated but garbage collected pointers.\n\nWhen Julia gc reclaims a KnetArray, a special finalizer keeps its pointer in a table instead of releasing the memory.  If an array with the same size in bytes is later requested, the same pointer is reused. The exact algorithm for allocation is:\n\nTry to find a previously allocated and garbage collected pointer in the current device. (0.5 μs)\nIf not available, try to allocate a new array using cudaMalloc. (10 μs)\nIf not successful, try running gc() and see if we get a pointer of the right size. (75 ms, but this should be amortized over all reusable pointers that become available due to the gc)\nFinally if all else fails, clean up all saved pointers in the current device using cudaFree and try allocation one last time. (25-70 ms, however this causes the elimination of all reusable pointers)\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "rnn = RNN(inputSize, hiddenSize; opts...)\nrnn(x; batchSizes) => y\nrnn.h, rnn.c  # hidden and cell states\n\nRNN returns a callable RNN object rnn. Given a minibatch of sequences x, rnn(x) returns y, the hidden states of the final layer for each time step. rnn.h and rnn.c fields can be used to set the initial hidden states and read the final hidden states of all layers.  Note that the final time step of y always contains the final hidden state of the last layer, equivalent to rnn.h for a single layer network.\n\nDimensions: The input x can be 1, 2, or 3 dimensional and y will have the same number of dimensions as x. size(x)=(X,[B,T]) and size(y)=(H/2H,[B,T]) where X is inputSize, B is batchSize, T is seqLength, H is hiddenSize, 2H is for bidirectional RNNs. By default a 1-D x represents a single instance for a single time step, a 2-D x represents a single minibatch for a single time step, and a 3-D x represents a sequence of identically sized minibatches for multiple time steps. The output y gives the hidden state (of the final layer for multi-layer RNNs) for each time step. The fields rnn.h and rnn.c represent the hidden states of all layers in a single time step and have size (H,B,L/2L) where L is numLayers and 2L is for bidirectional RNNs.\n\nbatchSizes: If batchSizes=nothing (default), all sequences in a minibatch are assumed to be the same length. If batchSizes is an array of (non-increasing) integers, it gives us the batch size for each time step (allowing different sequences in the minibatch to have different lengths). In this case x will typically be 2-D with the second dimension representing variable size batches for time steps. If batchSizes is used, sum(batchSizes) should equal length(x) ÷ size(x,1). When the batch size is different in every time step, hidden states will have size (H,B,L/2L) where B is always the size of the first (largest) minibatch.\n\nHidden states: The hidden and cell states are kept in rnn.h and rnn.c fields (the cell state is only used by LSTM). They can be initialized during construction using the h and c keyword arguments, or modified later by direct assignment. Valid values are nothing (default), 0, or an array of the right type and size possibly wrapped in a Param. If the value is nothing the initial state is assumed to be zero and the final state is discarded keeping the value nothing. If the value is 0 the initial state is assumed to be zero and 0 is replaced by the final state on return. If the value is a valid state, it is used as the initial state and is replaced by the final state on return.\n\nIn a differentiation context the returned final hidden states will be wrapped in Result types. This is necessary if the same RNN object is to be called multiple times in a single iteration. Between iterations (i.e. after diff/update) the hidden states need to be unboxed with e.g. rnn.h = value(rnn.h) to prevent spurious dependencies.

If not specified, any Param that takes part in the computation of func(args...) will be updated.\n\nThe common keyword argument gclip can be used to implement per-parameter gradient clipping. For a parameter gradient g, if norm(g) > gclip > 0, g is scaled so that its norm is equal to gclip. If not specified no gradient clipping is performed.\n\nThese functions do not perform optimization, but return an iterator that can. Any function that produces values from an iterator can be used with such an object, e.g. progress!(sgd(f,d)) iterates the sgd optimizer and displays a progress bar. For convenience, appending ! to the name of the function iterates and returns nothing, i.e. sgd!(...) is equivalent to (for x in sgd(...) end).\n\nWe define optimizers as lazy iterators to have explicit control over them:\n\nTo report progress use progress(sgd(f,d)).\nTo run until convergence use converge(sgd(f,cycle(d))).\nTo run multiple epochs use sgd(f,repeat(d,n)).\nTo run a given number of iterations use sgd(f,take(cycle(d),n)).\nTo do a task every n iterations use (task() for (i,j) in enumerate(sgd(f,d)) if i%n == 1).\n\nThese functions apply the same algorithm with the same configuration to every parameter by default. minimize takes an explicit optimizer argument, all others call minimize with an appropriate optimizer argument (see @doc update! for a list of possible optimizers). Before calling update! on a Param, minimize sets its opt field to a copy of this default optimizer if it is not already set. The opt field is used by the update! function to determine the type of update performed on that parameter.  If you need finer grained control, you can set the optimizer of an individual Param by setting its opt field before calling one of these functions. They will not override the opt field if it is already set, e.g. sgd(model,data) will perform an Adam update for a parameter whose opt field is an Adam object. This also means you can stop and start the training without losing optimization state, the first call will set the opt fields and the subsequent calls will not override them.\n\nGiven a parameter w and its gradient g here are the updates applied by each optimizer:\n\n# sgd (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent)\nw .= w - lr * g\n\n# momentum (http://jlmelville.github.io/mize/nesterov.html)\nv .= gamma * v - lr * g\nw .= w + v\n\n# nesterov (http://jlmelville.github.io/mize/nesterov.html)\nw .= w - gamma * v\nv .= gamma * v - lr * g\nw .= w + (1 + gamma) * v\n\n# adagrad (http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v12/duchi11a.html)\nG .= G + g .^ 2\nw .= w - lr * g ./ sqrt(G + eps)\n\n# rmsprop (http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf)\nG .= rho * G + (1-rho) * g .^ 2 \nw .= w - lr * g ./ sqrt(G + eps)\n\n# adadelta (http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5701)\nG .= rho * G + (1-rho) * g .^ 2\nupdate = sqrt(delta + eps) .* g ./ sqrt(G + eps)\nw = w - lr * update\ndelta = rho * delta + (1-rho) * update .^ 2\n\n# adam (http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980)\nv = beta1 * v + (1 - beta1) * g\nG = beta2 * G + (1 - beta2) * g .^ 2\nvhat = v ./ (1 - beta1 ^ t)\nGhat = G ./ (1 - beta2 ^ t)\nw = w - (lr / (sqrt(Ghat) + eps)) * vhat\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Non-differentiable functions such as sign, and non-numeric functions such as size should be defined using the @zerograd macro instead.\n\nExamples\n\n@primitive sin(x::Number)\n@primitive hypot(x1,x2),dy,y\n\n@primitive sin(x::Number),dy  (dy.*cos(x))\n@primitive hypot(x1,x2),dy,y  (dy.*x1./y)  (dy.*x2./y)\n\nThe first example shows that fx is a typed method declaration.  Julia supports multiple dispatch, i.e. a single function can have multiple methods with different arg types. AutoGrad takes advantage of this and supports multiple dispatch for primitives and gradients.\n\nThe second example specifies variable names for the output gradient dy and the output y after the method declaration which can be used in gradient expressions.  Untyped, ellipsis and keyword arguments are ok as in f(a::Int,b,c...;d=1).  Parametric methods such as f(x::T) where {T<:Number} cannot be used.\n\nThe method declaration can optionally be followed by gradient expressions.  The third and fourth examples show how gradients can be specified.  Note that the parameters, the return variable and the output gradient of the original function can be used in the gradient expressions.\n\nUnder the hood\n\nThe @primitive macro turns the first example into:\n\nsin(x::Value{T}) where {T<:Number} = forw(sin, x)\n\nThis will cause calls to sin with a boxed argument (Value{T<:Number}) to be recorded. The recorded operations are used by AutoGrad to construct a dynamic computational graph. With multiple arguments things are a bit more complicated.  Here is what happens with the second example:\n\nhypot(x1::Value{S}, x2::Value{T}) where {S,T} = forw(hypot, x1, x2)\nhypot(x1::S, x2::Value{T})        where {S,T} = forw(hypot, x1, x2)\nhypot(x1::Value{S}, x2::T)        where {S,T} = forw(hypot, x1, x2)\n\nWe want the forw method to be called if any one of the arguments is a boxed Value.  There is no easy way to specify this in Julia, so the macro generates all 2^N-1 boxed/unboxed argument combinations.\n\nIn AutoGrad, gradients are defined using gradient methods that have the following pattern:\n\nback(f,Arg{i},dy,y,x...) => dx[i]\n\nFor the third example here is the generated gradient method:\n\nback(::typeof(sin), ::Type{Arg{1}}, dy, y, x::Value{T}) where {T<:Number} = dy .* cos(x)\n\nFor the last example a different gradient method is generated for each argument:\n\nback(::typeof(hypot), ::Type{Arg{1}}, dy, y, x1::Value{S}, x2::Value{T}) where {S,T} = (dy .* x1) ./ y\nback(::typeof(hypot), ::Type{Arg{2}}, dy, y, x1::Value{S}, x2::Value{T}) where {S,T} = (dy .* x2) ./ y\n\nIn fact @primitive generates four more definitions for the other boxed/unboxed argument combinations.\n\nBroadcasting\n\nBroadcasting is handled by extra forw and back methods. @primitive defines the following  so that broadcasting of a primitive function with a boxed value triggers forw and back.\n\nbroadcasted(::typeof(sin), x::Value{T}) where {T<:Number} = forw(broadcasted,sin,x)\nback(::typeof(broadcasted), ::Type{Arg{2}}, dy, y, ::typeof(sin), x::Value{T}) where {T<:Number} = dy .* cos(x)\n\nIf you do not want the broadcasting methods, you can use the @primitive1 macro. If you only want the broadcasting methods use @primitive2. As a motivating example, here is how * is defined for non-scalars:\n\n@primitive1 *(x1,x2),dy  (dy*x2\')  (x1\'*dy)\n@primitive2 *(x1,x2),dy  unbroadcast(x1,dy.*x2)  unbroadcast(x2,x1.*dy)\n\nRegular * is matrix multiplication, broadcasted * is elementwise multiplication and the two have different gradients as defined above. unbroadcast(a,b) reduces b to the same shape as a by performing the necessary summations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "Arthur Samuel, the author of the first self-learning checkers program, defined machine learning as a \"field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed\". This leaves the definition of learning a bit circular. Tom M. Mitchell provided a more formal definition: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E,\" where the task, the experience, and the performance measure are to be specified based on the problem.We will start with supervised learning, where the task is to predict the output of an unknown process given its input, the experience consists of training data, a set of example input-output pairs, and the performance measure is given by a loss function which tells us how far the predictions are from actual outputs.  We model the unknown process using a prediction function, a parametric function that predicts the output of the process given its input.  Here is an example:haty = W x + bHere x is the model input, haty is the model output, W is a matrix of weights, and b is a vector of biases. By adjusting the parameters of this model, i.e. the weights and the biases, we can make it compute any linear function of x.\"All models are wrong, but some models are useful.\" George Box famously said. We do not necessarily know that the system whose output we are trying to predict is governed by a linear relationship. All we know is a finite number of input-output examples in the training data:mathcalD=(x_1y_1)ldots(x_Ny_N)It is just that we have to start model building somewhere and the set of all linear functions is a good place to start for now.A commonly used loss function in problems with numeric outputs is the squared error, i.e. the average squared difference between the actual output values and the ones predicted by the model. So our goal is to find model parameters that minimize the squared error:argmin_Wb frac1N sum_n=1^N  haty_n - y_n ^2Where haty_n = W x_n + b denotes the output predicted by the model for the n th example.There are several methods to find the solution to the problem of minimizing squared error. Here we will present the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method because it generalizes well to more complex models. In SGD, we take the training examples (individually or in groups), compute the gradient of the error for the current example(s) with respect to the parameters using the backpropagation algorithm, and move the parameters a small step in the direction that will decrease the error. First some notes on the math."

In particular we can talk about how J is effected by changing parameters W and b, as well as changing the input x, the model output haty, the desired output y, or intermediate values like z or r.

We will go over it in some detail as it forms the basis of the backpropagation algorithm. For now let us assume that each of the variables in the above example are scalars. We will start by looking at the effect of r on J and move backward from there. Basic calculus tells us that:beginaligned\nJ = r^2 \npartial Jpartial r = 2r\nendalignedThus, if r=5 and we decrease r by a small epsilon, the squared error J will go down by 10epsilon. Now let\'s move back a step and look at haty:beginaligned\nr = haty - y \npartial rpartial haty = 1\nendalignedSo how much effect will a small epsilon decrease in haty have on J when r=5? Well, when haty goes down by epsilon, so will r, which means J will go down by 10epsilon again. The chain rule expresses this idea:fracpartial Jpartialhaty = \nfracpartial Jpartial r\nfracpartial rpartialhaty\n= 2rGoing back further, we have:beginaligned\nhaty = z + b \npartial hatypartial b = 1 \npartial hatypartial z = 1\nendalignedWhich means b and z have the same effect on J as haty and r, i.e. decreasing them by epsilon will decrease J by 2repsilon as well. Finally:beginaligned\nz = w x \npartial zpartial x = w \npartial zpartial w = x\nendalignedThis allows us to compute the effect of w on J in several steps: moving w by epsilon will move z by xepsilon, haty and r will move exactly the same amount because their partials with z are 1, and finally since r moves by xepsilon, J will move by 2rxepsilon.fracpartial Jpartial w =\nfracpartial Jpartial r\nfracpartial rpartial haty\nfracpartial hatypartial z\nfracpartial zpartial w\n= 2rxWe can represent this process of computing partial derivatives as follows:(Image: image)Note that we have the same number of boxes and operations, but all the arrows are reversed. Let us call this the backward pass, and the original computation in the previous picture the forward pass. Each box in this backward-pass picture represents the partial derivative for the corresponding box in the previous forward-pass picture. Most importantly, each computation is local: each operation takes the partial derivative of its output, and multiplies it with a factor that only depends on the original input/output values to compute the partial derivative of its input(s). In fact we can implement the forward and backward passes for the linear regression model using the following local operations:(Image: image)(Image: image)(Image: image)(Image: image)This is basically the backpropagation algorithm in a nutshell, i.e.  backpropagation can be viewed as the application of Leibniz\' chain rule from 1660s to machine learning in 1980s."

    "text": "Over the years, people have noted many subtle problems with the SGD algorithm and suggested improvements:Step size: If the step sizes are too small, the SGD algorithm will take too long to converge. If they are too big it will overshoot the optimum and start to oscillate. So we scale the gradients with an adjustable parameter called the learning rate eta:w leftarrow w - eta nabla_w JStep direction: More importantly, it turns out the gradient (or its opposite) is often NOT the direction you want to go in order to minimize error. Let us illustrate with a simple picture:(Image: image)The figure on the left shows what would happen if you stood on one side of the long narrow valley and took the direction of steepest descent: this would point to the other side of the valley and you would end up moving back and forth between the two sides, instead of taking the gentle incline down as in the figure on the right. The direction across the valley has a high gradient but also a high curvature (second derivative) which means the descent will be sharp but short lived. On the other hand the direction following the bottom of the valley has a smaller gradient and low curvature, the descent will be slow but it will continue for a longer distance. Newton\'s method adjusts the direction taking into account the second derivative:(Image: image)In this figure, the two axes are w1 and w2, two parameters of our network, and the contour plot represents the error with a minimum at x.  If we start at x0, the Newton direction (in red) points almost towards the minimum, whereas the gradient (in green), perpendicular to the contours, points to the right.Unfortunately Newton\'s direction is expensive to compute. However, it is also probably unnecessary for several reasons: (1) Newton gives us the ideal direction for second degree objective functions, which our objective function almost certainly is not, (2) The error function whose gradient backprop calculated is the error for the last minibatch/instance only, which at best is a very noisy approximation of the real error function, thus we shouldn\'t spend too much effort trying to get the direction exactly right.So people have come up with various approximate methods to improve the step direction. Instead of multiplying each component of the gradient with the same learning rate, these methods scale them separately using their running average (momentum, Nesterov), or RMS (Adagrad, Rmsprop).  Some even cap the gradients at an arbitrary upper limit (gradient clipping) to prevent instabilities.You may wonder whether these methods still give us directions that consistently increase/decrease the objective function. If we do not insist on the maximum increase, any direction whose components have the same signs as the gradient vector is guaranteed to increase the function (for short enough steps). The reason is again given by the dot product nabla J cdot v. As long as these two vectors carry the same signs in the same components, the dot product, i.e. the rate of change along v, is guaranteed to be positive.Minimize what? The final problem with gradient descent, other than not telling us the ideal step size or direction, is that it is not even minimizing the right objective! We want small error on never before seen test data, not just on the training data. The truth is, a sufficiently large model with a good optimization algorithm can get arbitrarily low error (down to the noise limit) on any finite training data (e.g. by just memorizing the answers). And it can typically do so in many different ways (typically many different local minima for training error in weight space exist). Some of those ways will generalize well to unseen data, some won\'t. And unseen data is (by definition) not seen, so how will we ever know which weight settings will do well on it?There are at least three ways people deal with this problem: (1) Bayes tells us that we should use all possible models and weigh their answers by how well they do on training data (see Radford Neal\'s fbm), (2) New methods like dropout that add distortions and noise to inputs, activations, or weights during training seem to help generalization, (3) Pressuring the optimization to stay in one corner of the weight space (e.g. L1, L2, maxnorm regularization) helps generalization."

    "text": "A natural objective in classification could be to minimize the number of misclassified examples in the training data. This number is known as the zero-one loss. However the zero-one loss has some undesirable properties for training: in particular it is discontinuous. A small change in one of the parameters either has no effect on the loss, or can turn one or more of the predictions from false to true or true to false, causing a discontinuous jump in the objective. This means the gradient of the zero-one loss with respect to the parameters is either undefined or zero, thus not helpful.A more commonly used objective for classification is conditional likelihood: the probability of the observed data given our model and the inputs. Instead of predicting a single class for each instance, we let our model predict a probability distribution over all classes. Then we adjust the weights of the model to increase the probabilities for the correct classes and decrease it for others. This is also known as the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).Let mathcalX=x_1ldotsx_N be the inputs in the training data, mathcalY=y_1ldotsy_N be the correct classes and theta be the parameters of our model. Conditional likelihood is:L(theta) = P(mathcalYmathcalXtheta) \n= prod_n=1^N P(y_nx_ntheta)The second equation assumes that the data instances were generated independently. We usually work with log likelihood for mathematical convenience: log is a monotonically increasing function, so maximizing likelihood is the same as maximizing log likelihood:ell(theta) = log P(mathcalYmathcalXtheta) \n= sum_n=1^N log P(y_nx_ntheta)We will typically use the negative of ell (machine learning people like to minimize), which is known as negative log likelihood (NLL), or cross-entropy loss."

A model that converts the unnormalized values at the end of a linear regression to normalized probabilities for classification is called the softmax classifier.We need to figure out the backward pass for the softmax function.

    "text": "So far we have seen how to create a machine learning model as a differentiable program (linear regression, softmax classification) whose parameters can be adjusted to hopefully imitate whatever process generated our training data. A natural question to ask is whether a particular model can behave like any system we want (given the right parameters) or whether there is a limit to what it can represent.It turns out the softmax classifier is quite limited in its representational power: it can only represent linear classification boundaries. To show this, remember the form of the softmax classifier which gives the probability of the i\'th class as:p_i = fracexp y_isum_c=1^C exp y_cwhere y_i is a linear function of the input x. Note that p_i is a monotonically increasing function of y_i, so for two classes i and j, p_i  p_j iff y_i  y_j. The boundary between two classes i and j is the set of inputs for which the probability of the two classes are equal:beginalign*\np_i = p_j \ny_i = y_j \nw_i x + b_i = w_j x + b_j \n(w_i - w_j) x + (b_i - b_j) = 0\nendalign*where w_i b_i refer to the i\'th row of w and b. This is a linear equation, i.e. the border between two classes will always be linear in the input space with the softmax classifier:(Image: image)In the MNIST example, the relation between the pixels and the digit classes is unlikely to be this simple. That is why we are stuck at 6-7% training error. To get better results we need more powerful models."

Another question is whether there are functions multilayer perceptrons cannot represent and if so whether adding more layers or different types of functions would increase their representational power. The short answer is that a two layer model can approximate any function if the hidden layer is large enough, and can do so with any of the nonlinearities introduced in the last section. Multilayer perceptrons are universal function approximators!We said that a two-layer MLP is a universal function approximator given enough hidden units. This brings up the questions of efficiency: how many hidden units / parameters does one need to approximate a given function and whether the number of units depends on the number of hidden layers. The efficiency is important both computationally and statistically: models with fewer parameters can be evaluated faster, and can learn from fewer examples (ref?). It turns out there are functions whose representations are exponentially more expensive in a shallow network compared to a deeper network (see (Nielsen, 2016, Ch 5) for a discussion). Recent winners of image recognition contests use networks with dozens of convolutional layers. The advantage of deeper MLPs is empirically less clear, but you should experiment with the number of units and layers using a development set when starting a new problem.Please see (Nielsen, 2016, Ch 4) for an intuitive explanation of the universality result and (Bengio et al. 2016, Ch 6.4) for a more in depth discussion and references."

Here is our first attempt:function mlp3a(w, x0)\n    x1 = relu(w[1] * x0 .+ w[2])\n    x2 = relu(w[3] * x1 .+ w[4])\n    return w[5] * x2 .+ w[6]\nendWe can identify bad software engineering practices in this definition in that it contains a lot of repetition.The key to controlling complexity in computer languages is abstraction. Abstraction is the ability to name compound structures built from primitive parts, so they too can be used as primitives.Defining new operatorsWe could make the definition of mlp3 more compact by defining separate functions for its layers:function mlp3b(w, x0)\n    x1 = relu_layer1(w, x0)\n    x2 = relu_layer2(w, x1)\n    return pred_layer3(w, x2)\nend\n\nfunction relu_layer1(w, x)\n    return relu(w[1] * x .+ w[2])\nend\n\nfunction relu_layer2(w, x)\n    return relu(w[3] * x .+ w[4])\nend\n\nfunction pred_layer3(x)\n    return w[5] * x .+ w[6]\nendThis may make the definition of mlp3b a bit more readable. But it does not reduce the overall length of the program. The helper functions like relu_layer1 and relu_layer2 are too similar except for the weights they use and can be reduced to a single function.Increasing the number of layersWe can define a more general mlp model of arbitrary length. With weights of length 2n, the following model will have n layers, n-1 layers having the relu non-linearity:function mlp_nlayer(w,x)\n    for i=1:2:length(w)-2\n        x = relu(w[i] * x .+ w[i+1]))\n    end\n    return w[end-1] * x .+ w[end]\nendIn this example stacking the layers in a loop saved us only two lines, but the difference can be more significant in deeper models."

    "text": "Let\'s say we are trying to build a model that will detect cats in photographs. The average resolution of images in ILSVRC is 482x415, with three channels (RGB) this makes the typical input size 482x415x3=600,090. Each hidden unit connected to the input in a multilayer perceptron would have 600K parameters, a single hidden layer of size 1000 would have 600 million parameters. Too many parameters cause three types of problems: (1) runtime: large models are computationally costly to train and run. (2) memory: today\'s GPUs have limited amount of memory (4G-12G) and large networks fill them up quickly. (3) sample complexity: models with a large number of parameters are difficult to train without overfitting: we need a lot of data, strong regularization, and/or a good initialization to learn with large models.One problem with the MLP is that it is fully connected: every hidden unit is connected to every other in adjacent layers. The model does not assume any spatial relationships between pixels, in fact we can permute all the pixels in an image and the performance of the MLP would be the same!  We could instead have an architecture where each hidden unit is connected to a small patch of the image, say 40x40. Each such locally connected hidden unit would have 40x40x3=4800 parameters instead of 600K. For the price (in memory) of one fully connected hidden unit (600K), we could have 125 of these locally connected mini-hidden-units (4800 each) with receptive fields spread around the image.The second problem with the MLP is that it does not take advantage of the symmetry in the problem: a cat in the lower right corner of the image may be similar to a cat in the upper left corner. This means the local hidden units looking at these two patches can share the same weights. We can take one 40x40 cat filter and apply it to each 40x40 patch in the image taking up only 4800 parameters.A convolutional neural network (aka CNN or ConvNet) combines these two ideas and uses operations that are local and that share weights. CNNs commonly use three types of operations: convolution, pooling, and normalization which we describe next."

We get each entry in y by multiplying pairs of matching entries in x and w and summing the results. Matching entries in x and w are the ones whose indices add up to a constant. This can be visualized as flipping w, sliding it over x, and at each step writing their dot product into a single entry in y. Here is an example in Julia you should be able to calculate by hand:julia> using Knet\njulia> w = reshape([1.0,2.0,3.0], (3,1,1,1))\n3×1×1×1 Array{Float64,4}: [1,2,3]\njulia> x = reshape([1.0:7.0...], (7,1,1,1))\n7×1×1×1 Array{Float64,4}: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]\njulia> y = conv4(w, x)\n5×1×1×1 Array{Float64,4}: [10,16,22,28,34]conv4 is the convolution operation in Knet (based on the CUDNN implementation). For reasons that will become clear it works with 4-D and 5-D arrays, so we reshape our 1-D input vectors by adding extra singleton dimensions at the end.  The convolution of w=[1,2,3] and x=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7] gives y=[10,16,22,28,34]. For example, the third element of y, 22, can be obtained by reversing w to [3,2,1] and taking its dot product starting with the third element of x, [3,4,5]."

For inputs in D-dimensions we can specify padding with a D-tuple, e.g. padding=(1,2) for 2D, or a single number, e.g. padding=1 which is shorthand for padding=(1,1). The result will have Y=X+2P-W+1 elements where P is the padding size. Therefore to preserve the size of x when W=3 we should use padding=1.julia> y = conv4(w, x; padding=(1,0))\n7×1×1×1 Array{Float64,4}: [4,10,16,22,28,34,32]For example, to calculate the first entry of y, take the dot product of the inverted w, [3,2,1] with the first three elements of the padded x, [0 1 2].

The formulas we have given above relating the output size to the input and filter sizes, padding and stride parameters apply independently for each dimension.Knet supports 2D and 3D convolutions. The inputs and the filters have two extra dimensions at the end which means we use 4D and 5D arrays for 2D and 3D convolutions.

A D-dimensional input image is typically represented as a D+1 dimensional array with dimensions: X_1 ldots X_D C_x The first D dimensions X_1ldots X_D determine the spatial extent of the image. The last dimension C_x is the number of channels (aka slices, frames, maps, filters). The definition and number of channels is application dependent. We use C_x=3 for RGB images representing the intensity in three colors: red, green, and blue. For grayscale images we have a single channel, C_x=1. If you were developing a model for chess, we could have C_x=12, each channel representing the locations of a different piece type.In an actual CNN we do not typically hand-code the filters. Instead we tell the network: \"here are 1000 randomly initialized filters, you go ahead and turn them into patterns useful for my task.\" This means we usually work with banks of multiple filters simultaneously and GPUs have optimized operations for such filter banks. The dimensions of a typical filter bank are: W_1 ldots W_D C_x C_y The first D dimensions W_1ldots W_D determine the spatial extent of the filters. The next dimension C_x is the number of input channels, i.e. the number of filters from the previous layer, or the number of color channels of the input image.

    "text": "Convolution can be turned into a matrix multiplication, where certain entries in the matrix are constrained to be the same. The motivation is to be able to use efficient algorithms for matrix multiplication in order to perform convolution. The drawback is the large amount of memory needed due to repeated entries or sparse representations.Here is a matrix implementation for our first convolution example w=1ldots 3x=1ldots 7wast x = 1016222834:(Image: image)In this example we repeated the entries of the filter on multiple rows of a sparse matrix with shifted positions. Alternatively we can repeat the entries of the input to place each local patch on a separate column of an input matrix:(Image: image)The first approach turns w into a Ytimes X sparse matrix, wheras the second turns x into a Wtimes Y dense matrix.For 2-D images, typically the second approach is used: the local patches of the image used by convolution are stretched out to columns of an input matrix, an operation commonly called im2col. Each convolutional filter is stretched out to rows of a filter matrix. After the matrix multiplication the resulting array is reshaped into the proper output dimensions. The following figure illustrates these operations on a small example:(Image: image)It is also possible to go in the other direction, i.e. implement matrix multiplication (i.e. a fully connected layer) in terms of convolution. This conversion is useful when we want to build a network that can be applied to inputs of different sizes: the matrix multiplication would fail, but the convolution will give us outputs of matching sizes. Consider a fully connected layer with a weight matrix W of size Ktimes D mapping a D-dimensional input vector x to a K-dimensional output vector y. We can consider each of the K rows of the W matrix a convolution filter. The following example shows how we can reshape the arrays and use convolution for matrix multiplication:julia> using Knet\njulia> x = reshape([1.0:3.0...], (3,1))\n3×1 Array{Float64,2}:\n 1.0\n 2.0\n 3.0\njulia> w = reshape([1.0:6.0...], (2,3))\n2×3 Array{Float64,2}:\n 1.0  3.0  5.0\n 2.0  4.0  6.0\njulia> y = w * x\n2×1 Array{Float64,2}:\n 22.0\n 28.0\njulia> x2 = reshape(x, (3,1,1,1))\n3×1×1×1 Array{Float64,4}:\n[:, :, 1, 1] =\n 1.0\n 2.0\n 3.0\njulia> w2 = reshape(Array(w)\', (3,1,1,2))\n3×1×1×2 Array{Float64,4}:\n[:, :, 1, 1] =\n 1.0\n 3.0\n 5.0\n[:, :, 1, 2] =\n 2.0\n 4.0\n 6.0\njulia> y2 = conv4(w2, x2; mode=1)\n1×1×2×1 Array{Float64,4}:\n[:, :, 1, 1] =\n 22.0\n[:, :, 2, 1] =\n 28.0In addition to computational concerns, these examples also show that a fully connected layer can emulate a convolutional layer given the right weights and vice versa, i.e. convolution does not get us any extra representational power. However it does get us representational and statistical efficiency, i.e. the functions we would like to approximate are often expressed with significantly fewer parameters using convolutional layers and thus require fewer examples to train."

We will derive the backward pass for a 1-D example using the cross-correlation mode (no kernel flipping) to keep things simple. We will denote the cross-correlation operation with star to distinguish it from convolution denoted with ast. Here are the individual entries of y=wstar x:y_1 = x_1 w_1 + x_2 w_2 + x_3 w_3 + ldots \ny_2 = x_2 w_1 + x_3 w_2 + x_4 w_3 + ldots \ny_3 = x_3 w_1 + x_4 w_2 + x_5 w_3 + ldots \nldotsAs you can see, because of weight sharing the same w entry is used in computing multiple y entries. This means a single w entry effects the objective function through multiple paths and these effects need to be added. Denoting partial Jpartial y_i as y_i for brevity we have:w_1 = x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2 + ldots \nw_2 = x_2 y_1 + x_3 y_2 + ldots \nw_3 = x_3 y_1 + x_4 y_2 + ldots \nldots which can be recognized as another cross-correlation operation, this time between x and y. This allows us to write w=ystar x.Alternatively, we can use the equivalent matrix multiplication operation from the last section to derive the backward pass:(Image: image)If r is the matrix with repeated x entries in this picture, we have y=wr. Remember that the backward pass for matrix multiplication y=wr is w=yr^T:(Image: image)which can be recognized as the matrix multiplication equivalent of the cross correlation operation w=ystar x.Here is the gradient for the input:beginalign*\n x_1 = w_1 y_1 \n x_2 = w_2 y_1 + w_1 y_2 \n x_3 = w_3 y_1 + w_2 y_2 + w_1 y_3 \n ldots\nendalign*You can recognize this as a regular convolution between w and y with some zero padding.The following resources provide more detailed derivations of the backward pass for convolution:Goodfellow, I.

A pooling layer basically says: tell me whether this feature exists in a certain region of the image, I don\'t care exactly where. This makes the output of the layer invariant to small translations of the input. Pooling layers use large strides, typically as large as the window size, which reduces the size of their output.Like convolution, pooling slides a small window of a given size over the input optionally padded with zeros skipping stride pixels every step. In Knet by default there is no padding, the window size is 2, stride is equal to the window size and the pooling operation is max.

    "text": "We have seen a number of new operations: convolution, pooling, filters etc. How to best put these together to form a CNN is still an active area of research. In this section we summarize common patterns of usage in recent work based on (Karpathy, 2016).The operations in convolutional networks are usually ordered into   several layers of convolution-bias-activation-pooling sequences.   Note that the convolution-bias-activation sequence is an efficient   way to implement the common neural net function f(wx+b) for a   locally connected and weight sharing hidden layer.\nThe convolutional layers are typically followed by a number of fully   connected layers that end with a softmax layer for prediction (if we   are training for a classification problem).\nIt is preferrable to have multiple convolution layers with small   filter sizes rather than a single layer with a large filter size.   Consider three convolutional layers with a filter size of   3x3. The units in the top layer have receptive fields of   size 7x7. Compare this with a single layer with a filter   size of 7x7. The three layer architecture has two   advantages: The units in the single layer network is restricted to   linear decision boundaries, whereas the three layer network can be   more expressive. Second, if we assume C channels, the parameter   tensor for the single layer network has size 77CC whereas the   three layer network has three tensors of size 33CC i.e. a   smaller number of parameters. The one disadvantage of the three   layer network is the extra storage required to store the   intermediate results for backpropagation.\nThus common settings for convolution use 3x3 filters with   stride = padding = 1 (which incidentally preserves the input   size). The one exception may be a larger filter size used in the   first layer which is applied to the image pixels. This will save   memory when the input is at its largest, and linear functions may be   sufficient to express the low level features at this stage.\nThe pooling operation may not be present in every layer. Keep in   mind that pooling destroys information and having several   convolutional layers without pooling may allow more complex features   to be learnt. When pooling is present it is best to keep the window   size small to minimize information loss. The common settings for   pooling are window = stride = 2, padding = 0, which halves the   input size in each dimension.Beyond these general guidelines, you should look at the architectures used by successful models in the literature. Some examples are LeNet (LeCun et al. 1998), AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al. 2012), ZFNet (Zeiler and Fergus, 2013), GoogLeNet (Szegedy et al. 2014), VGGNet (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014), and ResNet (He et al. 2015)."

    "text": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are typically used in sequence processing applications such as natural language processing and generation. Some specific examples include:Sequence classification: given a sequence input, produce a fixed sized output, e.g. determine the \"sentiment\" of a product review.\nSequence generation: given a fixed sized input, produce a sequence output, e.g. automatic image captioning.\nSequence tagging: given a sequence, produce a label for each token, e.g. part-of-speech tagging.\nSequence-to-sequence mapping: given a sequence, produce another, not necessarily parallel, sequence. e.g. machine translation, speech recognition.All feed-forward models we have seen so far (Linear, MLP, CNN) have a common limitation: They are memoryless, i.e. they apply the same computational steps to each instance without any memory of previous instances. Each output is obtained from the current input and model parameters using a fixed number of common operations:haty_t = f(x_tw)A model with no memory is difficult to apply to variable sized inputs and outputs with nontrivial dependencies.  Let us take sequence tagging as an example problem.  To apply a feed-forward model to a sequence, one option is to treat each token of the sequence as an individual input:(Image: image)Applying the same computation to each input token makes sense only if the different input-output pairs are IID (independent and identically distributed).  However the IID assumption is violated in typical sequence processing applications like language modeling and speech recognition where the output of one time step may depend on the inputs and outputs from other time steps.<!--\n[](TODO: Applying a fixed number of computational steps: why limiting?when a single layer is universal?  check the proofs.)  \n[](fixed size api from karpathy)\n-->Another option is to treat the whole sequence as a single input:(Image: image)The first problem with this approach is that the inputs are of varying length.  We could potentially address this issue using a convolutional architecture, and this is a viable alternative for sequence classification problems.  However we have a more serious problem with variable length outputs: The space of possible outputs grow exponentially with length and output tokens have possible dependencies between them.  Problems of this type are known as \"structured prediction\", see (Smith 2011) for a good introduction. It is not clear how to generate and score variable sized outputs in a single shot with a single feed-forward model.<!--\n[](convolutions for sequences: Potential research topic!)\n[](exponential output growth: Can we tie this to fixed number of computational steps?)\n-->Finally we can generate each output token separately, but take a fixed sized window around the corresponding input token to take into account more context:(Image: image)This is the approach taken by, e.g. n-gram language models, and Bengio\'s MLP language model.  The problem with this approach is that we don\'t know how large the window needs to be.  In fact different tokens may require different sized windows, e.g. long range dependencies between words in a sentence.  RNNs provide a more elegant solution.RNNs process the input sequence one token at a time.  However, each output is not only a function of the current input, but some internal state determined by previous time steps:langlehaty_th_trangle = f(x_twh_t-1)(Image: image)The state h_t can be thought of as analogous to a memory device storing variables in a computer program.  In fact, RNNs have been proven to be Turing complete machines (however see this and this for a discussion).  At each time step, the RNN processes the current input x_t using the \"program\" specified by parameters w and the internal \"variables\" specified by h_t-1.  The program stores new values in its internal variables with h_t and possibly produces an output haty_t.<!--\n[](turing completeness, program analogy, but first figure out universality of mlp vs turing completeness of rnn)\n[](parameter sharing perspective, goodfellow: compare with 1-D convolution.)\n[](simple examples with irnn: adding, mnist-by-pixel, lm, timit, do we have data?)\n[](other possible examples: postag, charner.)\n-->"

This is best illustrated with a picture of an RNN unrolled in time:(Image: image) (image source)The picture on the left depicts an RNN influencing its own hidden state A while computing its output h for a single time step.  The equivalent picture on the right shows each time step as a separate column with its own input, state and output.  We need to keep in mind that the function that goes from the input and the previous state to the output and the next state is identical at each time step.  Viewed this way, there are no cycles in the computation graph and we can treat the RNN as just a multi-layer feed-forward net which (i) has as many layers as time steps, (ii) has weights shared between different layers, and (iii) may have multiple inputs and outputs received and produced at individual layers.Backpropagation through time (BPTT) is the SGD algorithm applied to RNNs unrolled in time.  First, the RNN is run and its outputs are collected for the whole sequence.  Then the losses for all outputs are calculated and summed.  Finally the backward pass goes over the computational graph for the whole sequence, accumulating the gradients of each parameter coming from different time steps.In practice, with Knet, all we have to do is to write a loss function that computes the total loss for the whole sequence and use its grad(f) for training.  Here is an example for a sequence tagger:function rnnloss(param,state,inputs,outputs)\n    # inputs and outputs are sequences of the same length\n    sumloss = 0\n    for t in 1:length(inputs)\n        prediction,state = rnn1(param,inputs[t],state)\n        sumloss += cross_entropy_loss(prediction,outputs[t])\n    end\n    return sumloss\nend\n\nrnngrad = grad(rnnloss)\n\n# train with our usual SGD procedure "

    "text": "RNNs can be difficult to train because gradients passed back through many layers may vanish or explode. To see why, let us first look at the evolution of the hidden state during the forward pass of an RNN. We will ignore the input and the bias for simplicity:h[t+1] = tanh(W*h[t]) = tanh(W*tanh(W*h[t-1])) = ...No matter how many layers we go through, the forward h values will remain in the [-1,1] range because of the squashing tanh function, no problems here.  However, look at what happens in the backward pass:dh[t] = W\' * (dh[t+1] .* f(h[t+1]))where dh[t] is the gradient of the loss with respect to h[t] and f is some elementwise function whose outputs are in the [-1,1] range (in the case of tanh, f(x)=(1+x)*(1-x)). The important thing to notice is that the dh gradients keep getting multiplied by the same matrix W\' over and over again as we move backward, and the backward pass is linear, i.e. there is no squashing function.What happens if we keep multiplying a vector u with the same matrix over and over again?  Suppose the matrix has an eigendecomposition VLambda V^-1.  After n multiplications in effect we will have multiplied with VLambda^n V^-1 where Lambda is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. The components of the gradient corresponding to eigenvalues greater than 1 will grow without a bound and the components for eigenvalues less than 1 will shrink towards zero. The gradient entries that grow without a bound destabilize SGD, and the ones that shrink to zero pass no information about the error back to the parameters.There are several possible solutions to these problems:Initialize the weights to avoid eigenvalues that are too large or too small. Even initializing the weights from a model successfully trained on some other task may help start them in the right regime.\nUse gradient clipping: this is the practice of downscaling gradients if their norm is above a certain threshold to help stabilize SGD.\nUse better optimization algorithms: methods like Adam and Adagrad adjust the learning rate for each parameter based on the history of updates and may be less sensitive to vanishing and exploding gradients.\nUse RNN modules designed to preserve long range information: modules such as LSTM and GRU are designed to help information flow better across time steps and are detailed in the next section.
