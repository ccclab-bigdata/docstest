The package has three dependencies (currently): StatsBase, Distributions, and DependentBootstrap. Support for DataFrames or TimeArrays is not currently available. If you use these types, convert your data to vectors or matrices before calling functions from this package.This package supports Julia v1.0. If you are running v0.5 or v0.6, you will need to use Pkg.pin(\"ForecastEval\", v\"0.1.0\") at the REPL. Versions prior to v0.5 are not supported."

Please type ?dm at the REPL for more information.Note that there are currently two options for performing a Diebold-Mariano test:The mean loss differential is scaled by a HAC variance estimate, and Normality of this statistic is assumed via a central limit theorem. This is sometimes referred to as the asymptotic method, and uses the DMHAC type as input, or can be called using the keyword signature.\nThe mean loss differential is bootstrapped using a block bootstrap procedure. This method uses the DMBoot type as input, or can be called using the keyword signature."

Note that the MCSBootLowRAM results are not guaranteed to be identical to those of MCSBoot. The vast majority of users will want to use MCSBoot, since MCSBootLowRAM doesn\'t allow many additional forecast models to be included (RAM requirements go up by a power law in the number of models, not linearly). I would be very receptive to any pull requests that are able to speed up the run-time of MCSBootLowRAM. The essential difference between the two algorithms is that MCSBoot wastes additional RAM but with the benefit of being able to perform mean computations on matrices in column-major order using BLAS routines.

The first argument of spa is a matrix where the kth column of the matrix is created by the operation: \n\nL(xk, y) - L(x0, y) \n\nNote that the forecast loss comes first and the base case loss comes second. This is the opposite to what is described in Hansen\'s paper. \n\nThe second method argument determines which methodology to use. Currently, only SPABoot is available and if this input type is provided, the keyword arguments are not needed. Alternatively, the user can omit the second argument, and then any keyword arguments will be passed to the SPABoot constructor. See ?SPABoot for more detail. The most relevant keyword arguments are:     alpha=0.05 <- The confidence level to use in the test \n\nkernelfunction=KernelEpanechnikov() <- The kernel function to use with HAC variance estimator. See ?hacvariance for more detail. \n\nbandwidth=-1 <- The bandwidth for HAC variance estimator. If bandwidth <= -1 then bandwidth is estimated using Politis (2003) \"Adaptive Bandwidth Choice\" \n\nblocklength=0.0 <- Block length to use with the bootstrap. Default of 0.0 implies\n    the block length will be optimally estimated from the data use the method deemed\n    most appropriate by the DependentBootstrap package (typically the selection procedure\n    of Patton, Politis, and White (2009)). \n\nnumresample=1000 <- Number of resamples to use when bootstrapping. \n\nbootmethod=:stationary <- Bootstrap methodology to use, where the default is the\n    stationary bootstrap of Politis and Romano (1993)\n\nThe output of an SPA test is of type SPATest. Use ?SPATest for more information. \n\nNote, Hansen suggests using the Stationary Bootstrap implied HAC variance estimator, which is not currently supported in this package. However, note that any consistent HAC estimator is valid and in many cases may be preferred.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
