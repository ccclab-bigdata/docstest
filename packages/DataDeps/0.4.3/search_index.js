If you are willing to tag a new relase of your package each time the data changes, then maybe this is no worry, but maybe it is.But the real question is, is DataDeps.jl really suitable for managing your data properly in the first place. DataDeps.jl does not provide for versioning of data â€“ you can\'t force users to download new copies of your data using DataDeps. There are work arounds, such as using DataDeps.jl + deps/build.jl to rm(datadep\"MyData\", recursive=true, force=true every package update. Or considering each version of the data as a different datadep with a different name. DataDeps.jl may form part of your overall solution or it may not. That is a discussion to have on Slack or Discourse (feel free to tag me, I am @oxinabox on both). See also the list of related packages at the bottomThe other option is that if your data a good fit for git. If it is in overlapping area of plaintext & small (or close enough to those things), then you could add it as a ManualDataDep in and include it in the git repo in the  deps/data/ folder of your package.

Just like when using the plain datadep\"Name\" this will if required downloadload the whole datadep (not just the file).

That is to say if the user never calls a function that requires that data, then the data should not be downloaded.DataDeps.jl resolves the dependency when a datadep\"Name\" string is evaluated. If no code containing a data dependency string is run, then no data will be downloadedThe basic way is to hide the datadep in some code not being evaluated except on a condition. For example, say some webcam security system can be run in training mode, in which case data should be used from the datadep, or in deployment mode, in which case the data should be read from the webcam\'s folder:data_folder = training_mode ? datadep\"SecurityFootage\" : \"/srv/webcam/today\"       The data will not be downloaded if training_mode==false, because the referred to folder is never required. Of-course if the data was already downloaded, then it wouldn\'t be downloaded again either way.Another example of a particularly nice way of doing this is to use the datadep string as the default value for a function paramater function predict(path=datadep\"SecurityFootage\"). If the user passses a value when they call predict then the datadep string will never be evaluated. So the data will not be sourced via DataDeps.jl"

    "text": "fetch_method, post_fetch_method and checksum all can match the structure of remote_path. If remote_path is just an single path, then they each must be single items. If remote_path is a vector, then if those properties are a vector (which must be the same length) then they are applied each to the corresponding element; or if not then it is applied to all of them. This means you can for example provide check-sums per file, or per-the-all. It also means you can specify different post_fetch_methods for different files, e.g. doing nothing to some, and extracting others. Further more this applies recursively.For example:register(DataDep(\"eg\", \"eg message\",\n    [\"http//example.com/text.txt\", \"http//example.com/sub1.zip\", \"http//example.com/sub2.zip\"]\n    post_fetch_method = [identity, file->run(`unzip $file`), file->run(`unzip $file`)]\n))So identity  (i.e. nothing) will be done to the first paths resulting file, and the second and third will be unzipped.can also be written:register(DataDep(\"eg\", \"eg message\",\n    [\"http//example.com/text.txt\", [\"http//example.com/sub1.zip\", \"http//example.com/sub2.zip\"]]\n    post_fetch_method = [identity, file->run(`unzip $file`)]\n))The unzip will be applied to both elements in the child array"

For example ~/.julia/v0.6/EXAMPLEPKG/deps/data/EXAMPLEDATADEP/, for the package EXAMPLEPKG, and the datadep EXAMPLEDATADEP.Ideally though you should probably raise an issue with the package maintainers and see if one (or both) of them want to change the DataDep name.Note also when it comes to file level loading, e.g. datadep\"Name/subfolder/file.txt\", DataDeps does not check all folders with that Name (if you have multiples).

You can also encapsulate an DataDep as one of the elements of your new type.If you do this you might like to contribute the type back up to this repository, so others can use it also.

    "text": "DataDeps.jl isn\'t the answer to all your download needs. It is focused squarely on static data. It might not be good for your use case.Alternatives that I am aware of are:RemoteFiles.jl: keeps local files up to date with remotes\nBinaryProvider.jl downloads binaries intended as part of a build chain. I\'m pretty sure you can trick it into downloading data.\nBase.download if your situtation is really simple just sticking a download into the deps/build.jl file might do you just fine.Outside of julia\'s ecosystem isPython: Quilt. Quilt uses a centralised data store, and allows the user to download the data as Python packages containing it in serialised from. It might be possible to use PyCall.jl to use this from julia.\nR: suppdata, features extra stuff relating to published datasets (See also DataDepsGenerators.jl), it might be possible to use RCall.jl to use this from julia.\nNode/Commandline: Datproject I\'m not too familiar with this, it is a bit of an ecosystem of its own. I think using it from the commandline might satisfy many people\'s needs. Or automating it with shell calls in build.jl."
