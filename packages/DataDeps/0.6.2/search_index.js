For those edge cases ManualDataDeps are good (see below).DataDeps.jl is good for:Any file format\nAny size\nStatic (that is to say it doesn\'t change)The main use case is downloading large datasets for machine learning, and corpora for NLP.

If you are willing to tag a new relase of your package each time the data changes, then maybe this is no worry, but maybe it is.But the real question is, is DataDeps.jl really suitable for managing your data properly in the first place. DataDeps.jl does not provide for versioning of data â€“ you can\'t force users to download new copies of your data using DataDeps. There are work arounds, such as using DataDeps.jl + deps/build.jl to rm(datadep\"MyData\", recursive=true, force=true every package update. Or considering each version of the data as a different datadep with a different name. DataDeps.jl may form part of your overall solution or it may not. That is a discussion to have on Slack or Discourse (feel free to tag me, I am @oxinabox on both). See also the list of related packages at the bottomThe other option is that if your data a good fit for git. If it is in overlapping area of plaintext & small (or close enough to those things), then you could add it as a ManualDataDep in and include it in the git repo in the  deps/data/ folder of your package. The ManuaulDataDep will not need manual installation if it is being installed via git."

    "text": "DataDeps.jl isn\'t the answer to everyone\'s download needs. It is focused squarely on static data. It is opinionated about providing user readable metadata at a prompt that must be accepted. It doesn\'t try to understand what the data means at all. It might not be good for your use case.Alternatives that I am aware of are:RemoteFiles.jl: keeps local files up to date with remotes. In someways it is the opposite of DataDeps.jl (which means it is actually very similar in many ways).\nBinaryProvider.jl downloads binaries intended as part of a build chain. I\'m pretty sure you can trick it into downloading data.\nBase.download if your situtation is really simple just sticking a download into the deps/build.jl file might do you just fine.Outside of julia\'s ecosystem isPython: Quilt. Quilt uses a centralised data store, and allows the user to download the data as Python packages containing it in serialised from. It might be possible to use PyCall.jl to use this from julia.\nR: suppdata, features extra stuff relating to published datasets (See also DataDepsGenerators.jl), it might be possible to use RCall.jl to use this from julia.\nNode/Commandline: Datproject I\'m not too familiar with this, it is a bit of an ecosystem of its own. I think using it from the commandline might satisfy many people\'s needs. Or automating it with shell calls in build.jl."

(If you delete this, it will go to another location But you can move them from there to anywhere in the DATADEPS_LOADPATH. (See below)If you have a large chunk of data that everyone in your lab is using (e.g. a 1TB video corpora), you probably want to shift it to a shared area, like /usr/share/datadeps.

If it doesn\'t, please file an issue. (Unless your location is super-specific, e.g. /MyUniName/student/commons/datadeps). As mentioned you can add things to the load path by setting the environment variable DATADEPS_LOAD_PATH. You can also make symlinks from the locations on the loadpath to other locations where the data really is, if you\'ld rather do that.When loading data the load path is searched in order for a readable folder of the right now. When saving data is it is searched in order, skipping the package load path, for a writable directory. Simple way to avoid part of the standard loadpath being used for saving is to delete it, or make it unwritable. You can (and should when desired) move things around between any folder in the load path without redownloading."

    "text": "You probably don\'t want to have multiple copies of a DataDir with the same name. DataDeps.jl will try to handle it as gracefuly as it can. But having different DataDep under the same name, is probably going to lead to packages loading the wrong one. Except if they are (both) located in their packages deps/data folder.By moving a package\'s data dependency into its package directory under deps/data, it becomes invisible except to that package. For example ~/.julia/v0.6/EXAMPLEPKG/deps/data/EXAMPLEDATADEP/, for the package EXAMPLEPKG, and the datadep EXAMPLEDATADEP.Ideally though you should probably raise an issue with the package maintainers and see if one (or both) of them want to change the DataDep name.Note also when it comes to file level loading, e.g. datadep\"Name/subfolder/file.txt\", DataDeps does not check all folders with that Name (if you have multiples). If the file is not in the first folder it finds you will be presented with the recovery dialog, from which the easiest option is to select to delete the folder and retry, since that will result in it checking the second folder (as the first one does not exist)."

    "text": "Most packages using more than one data source, will want to download them only when the user requires them. That is to say if the user never calls a function that requires that data, then the data should not be downloaded.DataDeps.jl resolves the dependency when a datadep\"Name\" string is evaluated. If no code containing a data dependency string is run, then no data will be downloadedThe basic way is to hide the datadep in some code not being evaluated except on a condition. For example, say some webcam security system can be run in training mode, in which case data should be used from the datadep, or in deployment mode, in which case the data should be read from the webcam\'s folder:data_folder = training_mode ? datadep\"SecurityFootage\" : \"/srv/webcam/today\"       The data will not be downloaded if training_mode==false, because the referred to folder is never required. Of-course if the data was already downloaded, then it wouldn\'t be downloaded again either way.Another example of a particularly nice way of doing this is to use the datadep string as the default value for a function paramater function predict(path=datadep\"SecurityFootage\"). If the user passses a value when they call predict then the datadep string will never be evaluated. So the data will not be sourced via DataDeps.jl"

This means you can for example provide check-sums per file, or per-the-all. It also means you can specify different post_fetch_methods for different files, e.g. doing nothing to some, and extracting others. Further more this applies recursively.For example:register(DataDep(\"eg\", \"eg message\",\n    [\"http//example.com/text.txt\", \"http//example.com/sub1.zip\", \"http//example.com/sub2.zip\"]\n    post_fetch_method = [identity, file->run(`unzip $file`), file->run(`unzip $file`)]\n))So identity  (i.e. nothing) will be done to the first paths resulting file, and the second and third will be unzipped.can also be written:register(DataDep(\"eg\", \"eg message\",\n    [\"http//example.com/text.txt\", [\"http//example.com/sub1.zip\", \"http//example.com/sub2.zip\"]]\n    post_fetch_method = [identity, file->run(`unzip $file`)]\n))The unzip will be applied to both elements in the child array"

    "category": "section",
    "text": "The primary point of extension for DataDeps.jl is in developers defining their own DataDep types. 99% of developers won\'t need to do this, a ManualDataDep or a normal (automatic) DataDep covers most use cases. However, if for example you want to have a DataDep that after the download is complete and after the post_fetch_method is run, does an additional validation, or some data synthesis step that requires working with multiple of the files simultaneously (which post_fetch_method can not do), or a SemiManualDataDep where the user does some things and then other things happen automatically, then this can be done by creating your own AbstractDataDep type.The code for ManualDataDep is a good place to start looking to see how that is done. You can also encapsulate an DataDep as one of the elements of your new type.If you do this you might like to contribute the type back up to this repository, so others can use it also. Particularly, if it is something that generalises beyond your specific usecase."
