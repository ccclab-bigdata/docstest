    "text": "To build a julia program into an application, you\'ll need to do two steps:Wrap your code in julia_main function. If the main entry-point to your code is a function, my_code(), it would look like this:  ```julia\nmyjuliamain.jl\ninclude(\"mycode.jl\")  Base.@ccallable function juliamain(ARGS::Vector{String})::Cint      return my_code()  end  ```  The easiest thing to do is to maintain this as a separate script, but you can put this anywhere in your project.\nCall build_app_bundle with the file that provides julia_main. The easiest way to do this is to maintain a build script, e.g.:  ```julia\nbuild.jl\nusing ApplicationBuilder  buildappbundle(\"src/myjuliamain.jl\", appname=\"MyCode\");  ```"

Many Julia packages come bundled with their own binary dependencies, and if you want to use them in your app, you\'ll have to add those dependencies via the libraries (-L) option for libs and resources (-R) for bundle resources."
