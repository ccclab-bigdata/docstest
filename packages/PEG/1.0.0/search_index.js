Use parse_whole.\nparse streams. Use open(x->parse_whole(rule, read(x, String)), args...).\ninclude parsers for two random languages.\nhas nicer syntax:\nOperator precedence makes sense. Tight to loose, the operators are: postfix [] (whatever is in the brackets), prefix +/-, infix &, |>/>, ,.\nPC\'s Plus(x) and Star(x) become actual plusses and stars: x[+] and x[*]. And PEG has x[:?] too.\nEqual/@e_str and Pattern/@p_str are unneccessary, just use bare strings and regexen (with extra flags).\ndoes not require mutual recursion loops to be broken with Delayed().\ndoes not have special types for matchers/rules, and does not require a trampoline to \"interpret\" them.
