    "text": "(Image: Build Status)This package provides the function pdesolvethat solves (system of) nonlinear ODEs/PDEs arising in economic models.It is fast: the underlying algorithm has a quadratic rate of convergence around the solution.\nIt is robust: the underlying algorithm is based on a combination of upwinding and non-linear time stepping (more details here)\nIt is simple-to-use: one can solve a PDE in less than 10 lines of codes. No need to explicitly set up the finite-difference scheme."

    "title": "Boundary Conditions",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "When solving a PDE using a finite scheme approach, one needs to specify the value of the solution outside the grid (\"ghost node\") to construct the second derivative and, in some cases, the first derivative at the boundary. By default, this package assumes that the value outside the grid is the same as the value at the boundary. I go through several cases for lower boundaries (upper boundaries are similar):First Case: at the lower boundary of the grid, the state variable has a positive drift and positive volatility.This happens in models where the state space is unbounded (see Habit, Long Run Risk, and Disaster models). Because the PDE needs to be solved on a grid, one needs to impose reflecting boundaries, i.e. that the first derivative of the value function is null at the border. In term of finite difference scheme, this means that the value of the function outside the grid is equal to the value *at* the boundary. This is the default boundary condition used by `pdesolve`Second Case: at the lower boundary of the grid, the state variable has a positive drift and zero volatility.This happens in heterogeneous agent models such as GarleanuPanageas and DiTella models. In this case, the second derivative does not appear in the PDE at the boundary. Because of upwinding, the first derivative does not use the value of the function outside the grid either. Therefore, there is no need to specify the value of the function outside the grid.Third case: at the lower boundary of the grid, the state variable has a negative drift and zero volatility.This happens in consumption / saving models with borrowing constraint. Typically, the agent would like to consume but there is an exogeneous constraint on how low his wealth can be. In this case, specify the value of the first derivative to be such that the agent chooses to stay in the state space when the drift of the state variable initially makes it go outside the boundary. See WangWangYang model or AchdouHanLasryLionsMoll in the example folder.Sometime, the boundary condition does not fall into one of these cases. When this happens, specify particular values for the derivative at the boundaries using the bc option (see BoltonChenWang model in the example folder)."

    "text": "In some cases, one may want to save the iteration over time rather than the stationary solution. In this case, use pdesolve(f, state, y0, ts)  where ts is a vector of time and y_0 is the solution at time ts[1]. See ArbitrageHoldingCosts for an example."
