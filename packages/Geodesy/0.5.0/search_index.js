    "text": "Package Evaluator Build Status\n(Image: 0.5 package tests) (Image: 0.6 package tests) (Image: Linux/macOS) (Image: Windows) (Image: Coverage)Geodesy is a Julia package for working with points in various world and local coordinate systems. The primary feature of Geodesy is to define and perform coordinate transformations in a convenient and safe framework, leveraging the CoordinateTransformations package. Transformations are accurate and efficient and implemented in native Julia code (with many functions being ported from Charles Karney\'s GeographicLib C++ library), and some common geodetic datums are provided for convenience."

    "text": "Lets define a 3D point by its latitude, longitude and altitude (LLA):x_lla = LLA(-27.468937, 153.023628, 0.0) # City Hall, Brisbane, AustraliaThis can be converted to a Cartesian Earth-Centered-Earth-Fixed (ECEF) coordinate simply by calling the constructorx_ecef = ECEF(x_lla, wgs84)Here we have used the WGS-84 ellipsoid to calculate the transformation, but other datums such as osgb36, nad27 and grs80 are provided. All transformations use the CoordinateTransformations\' interface, and the above is short forx_ecef = ECEFfromLLA(wgs84)(x_lla)where ECEFfromLLA is a type inheriting from CoordinateTransformations\' Transformation. (Similar names XfromY exist for each of the coordinate types.)Often, points are measured or required in a local frame, such as the north-east-up coordinates with respect to a given origin. The ENU type represents points in this coordinate system and we may transform between ENU and globally referenced coordinates using ENUfromLLA, etc.origin_lla = LLA(-27.468937, 153.023628, 0.0) # City Hall, Brisbane, Australia\npoint_lla = LLA(-27.465933, 153.025900, 0.0)  # Central Station, Brisbane, Australia\n\n# Define the transformation and execute it\ntrans = ENUfromLLA(origin_lla, wgs84)\npoint_enu = trans(point_lla)\n\n# Equivalently\npoint_enu = ENU(point_enu, point_origin, wgs84)Similarly, we could convert to UTM/UPS coordinates, and two types are provided for this - UTM stores 3D coordinates x, y, and z in an unspecified zone, while UTMZ includes the zone number and hemisphere bool (where true = northern, false = southern). To get the canonical zone for your coordinates, simply use:x_utmz = UTMZ(x_lla, wgs84)If you are transforming a large number of points to or from a given zone, it may be more effective to define the transformation explicitly and use the lighter UTM storage type.points_lla::Vector{LLA{Float64}}\nutm_from_lla = UTMfromLLA(56, false, wgs84) # Zone 56-South\npoints_utm = map(utm_from_lla, points_lla) # A new vector of UTM coordinatesGeodesy becomes particularly powerful when you chain together transformations. For example, you can define a single transformation from your data on disk in UTM coordinates to a local frame in ENU coordinates. Internally, this will perform UTM (+ zone) → LLA → ECEF → ENU via composing transformations with ∘ into a ComposedTransformation:julia> origin = LLA(-27.468937, 153.023628, 0.0) # City Hall, Brisbane, Australia\nLLA(lat=-27.468937°, lon=153.023628°, alt=0.0)\n\njulia> trans = ENUfromUTMZ(origin, wgs84)\n(ENUfromECEF(ECEF(-5.046925124630393e6, 2.5689157252069353e6, -2.924416653602336e6), lat=-27.468937°, lon=153.023628°) ∘ (ECEFfromLLA(wgs84) ∘ LLAfromUTMZ(wgs84)))This transformation can then be composed with rotations and translations in CoordinateTransformations (or your own custom-defined AbstractTransformation to define further reference frames. For example, in this way, a point measured by a scanner on a moving vehicle at a particular time may be globally georeferenced with a single call to the Transformation!Finally, the Cartesian distance between world points can be calculated via automatic transformation to a Cartesian frame:x_lla = LLA(-27.468937, 153.023628, 0.0) # City Hall, Brisbane, Australia\ny_lla = LLA(-27.465933, 153.025900, 0.0) # Central Station, Brisbane, Australia\ndistance(x_lla, y_lla)                   # 401.54 meters(assuming the wgs84 datum, which can be configured in distance(x, y, datum))."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "A position on the Earth can be given by some numerical coordinate values, but those don\'t mean much without more information.  The extra information is called the Coordinate Reference System or CRS (also known as a Spatial Reference System or SRS).  A CRS tells you two main things:The measurement procedure: which real world objects were used to define the frame of reference or datum of the measurement?\nThe coordinate system: how do coordinate numerical values relate to the reference frame defined by the datum?The full specification of a CRS can be complex, so a short label called a Spatial Reference IDentifier or SRID is usually used instead.  For example, EPSG:4326 is one way to refer to the 2D WGS84 latitude and longitude you\'d get from a mobile phone GPS device.  An SRID is of the form AUTHORITY:CODE, where the code is a number and the authority is the name of an organization maintaining a list of codes with associated CRS information.  There are services where you can look up a CRS, for example, http://epsg.io is a convenient interface to the SRIDs maintained by the European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) authority.  Likewise, http://spatialreference.org is an open registry to which anyone can contribute.When maintaining a spatial database, it\'s typical to define an internal list of SRIDs (effectively making your organization the authority), and a mapping from these to CRS information.  A link back to a definitive SRID from an external authority should also be included where possible."

    "title": "Datums",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "In spatial measurement and positioning, a datum is a set of reference objects and assigned coordinates relative to which other objects may be positioned.  For example, in traditional surveying a datum might comprise a pair of pegs in the ground, separated by a carefully measured distance.  When surveying the position of an unknown but nearby point, the angle back to the original datum objects can be measured using a theodolite.  After this, the relative position of the new point can be computed using simple triangulation. Repeating this trick with any of the now three known points, an entire triangulation network of surveyed objects can be extended outward.  Any point surveyed relative to the network is said to be measured in the datum of the original objects.  Datums are often named with an acronym, for example OSGB36 is the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain, 1936.In the era of satellite geodesy, coordinates are determined for an object by timing signals from a satellite constellation (eg, the GPS satellites) and computing position relative to those satellites.  Where is the datum here? At first glance the situation seems quite different from the traditional setup described above.  However, the satellite positions as a function of time (ephemerides, in the jargon) must themselves be defined relative to some frame. This is done by continuously observing the satellites from a set of highly stable ground stations equipped with GPS receivers. It is the full set of these ground stations and their assigned coordinates which form the datum.Let\'s inspect the flow of positional information in both cases:For traditional surveying,\ndatum object positions -> triangulation network -> newly surveyed point\nFor satellite geodesy,\ndatum object positions -> satellite ephemerides -> newly surveyed pointWe see that the basic nature of a datum is precisely the same regardless of whether we\'re doing a traditional survey or using a GPS receiver."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Coordinates for new points are measured by transferring coordinates from the datum objects, as described above.  However, how do we decide on coordinates for the datum objects themselves?  This is purely a matter of convention, consistency and measurement.For example, the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) is a reference system that rotates with the Earth so that the average velocity of the crust is zero. That is, in this reference system the only crust movement is geophysical.  Roughly speaking, the defining conventions for the ITRS are:Space is modeled as a three-dimensional Euclidean affine space.\nThe origin is at the center of mass of the Earth (it is geocentric).\nThe z-axis is the axis of rotation of the Earth.\nThe scale is set to 1 SI meter.\nThe x-axis is orthogonal to the z-axis and aligns with the international reference meridian through Greenwich.\nThe y-axis is set to the cross product of the z and x axes, forming a right handed coordinate frame.\nVarious rates of change of the above must also be specified, for example, the scale should stay constant in time.The precise conventions are defined in chapter 4 of the IERS conventions published by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Service (IERS). These conventions define an ideal reference system, but they\'re useless without physical measurements that give coordinates for a set of real world datum objects.  The process of measuring and computing coordinates for datum objects is called realizing the reference system and the result is called a reference frame.  For example, the International Terrestrial Reference Frame of 2014 (ITRF2014) realizes the ITRS conventions using raw measurement data gathered in the 25 years prior to 2014.To measure and compute coordinates, several space geodesy techniques are used to gather raw measurement data; currently the IERS includes VLBI (very long baseline interferometry) of distant astronomical radio sources, SLR (satellite laser ranging), GPS (global positioning system) and DORIS (gosh these acronyms are tiring). The raw data is not in the form of positions, but must be condensed down in a large scale fitting problem, ideally by requiring physical and statistical consistency of all measurements, tying measurements at different sites together with physical models."

    "title": "Coordinate systems",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "In geometry, a coordinate system is a system which uses one or more numbers, or coordinates to uniquely determine the position of a point in a mathematical space such as Euclidean space.  For example, in geodesy a point is commonly referred to using geodetic latitude, longitude and height relative to a given reference ellipsoid; this is called a geodetic coordinate system.An ellipsoid is chosen because it\'s a reasonable model for the shape of the Earth and its gravitational field without being overly complex; it has only a few parameters, and a simple mathematical form.  The term spheroid is also used because the ellipsoids in use today are rotationally symmetric around the pole. Note that there\'s several ways to define latitude on an ellipsoid. The most natural for geodesy is geodetic latitude, used by default because it\'s physically accessible in any location as a good approximation to the angle between the gravity vector and the equatorial plane.  (This type of latitude is not an angle measured at the centre of the ellipsoid, which may be surprising if you\'re used to spherical coordinates!)There are usually several useful coordinate systems for the same space.  As well as the geodetic coordinates mentioned above, it\'s common to seeThe x,y,z components in an Earth-Centred Cartesian coordinate system rotating with the Earth.  This is conventionally called an Earth-Centred Earth-Fixed (ECEF) coordinate system. This is a natural coordinate system in which to define coordinates for the datum objects defining a terrestrial reference frame.\nThe east,north and up ENU components of a Cartesian coordinate frame at a particular point on the ellipsoid.  This coordinate system is useful as a local frame for navigation.\nEasting,northing and vertical components of a projected coordinate system or map projection. There\'s an entire zoo of these, designed to represent the curved surface of an ellipsoid with a flat map.Different coordinates systems provide different coordinates for the same point, so it\'s obviously important to specify exactly which coordinate system you\'re using.  In particular, you should specify which ellipsoid parameters are in use if you deal with latitude and longitude, as in principle you could have more than one ellipsoid.  This is a point of confusion, because a datum in geodesy also comes with a reference ellipsoid as a very strong matter of convention (thus being called a geodetic datum).With its conventional ellipsoid, a geodetic datum also defines a conventional geodetic coordinate system, thus bringing together concepts which are interconnected but conceptually distinct.  To emphasize:A coordinate system is a mathematical abstraction allowing us to manipulate geometric quantities using numeric and algebraic techniques.  By itself, mathematical geometry is pure abstraction without a connection to the physical world.\nA datum is a set of physical objects with associated coordinates, thereby defining a reference frame in a way which is physically accessible.  A datum is the bridge which connects physical reality to the abstract ideal of mathematical geometry, via the algebraic mechanism of a coordinate system."

The transformation retains a cache of the parameters used in the transformation, which in the case of the transverse-Mercator projection leads to a significant saving.In all cases zone 0 corresponds to the UPS coordinate system, and the polar-stereographic projection of GeographicLib has been ported to Julia to perform the transformation.An approximate, 6th-order expansion is used by default for the transverse-Mercator projection and its inverse (though orders 4-8 are defined). The algorithm is a native Julia port of that used in GeographicLib, and is accurate to nanometers for up to several UTM zones away from the reference meridian. However, the series expansion diverges at ±90° from the reference meridian. While the UTMZ-methods will automatically choose the canonical zone and hemisphere for the input, extreme care must be taken to choose an appropriate zone for the UTM methods. (In the future, we implement the exact UTM transformation as a fallback — contributions welcome!)There is also UTMfromUTMZ and UTMZfromUTM transformations that are helpful for converting between these two formats and putting data into the same UTM zone."

Note however that many devices can also provide position in a national datum, so you should check your device settings to be sure.\n\nAs a special case for low accuracy work (worse than a meter or so), WGS84 will assume that coordinates supplied without a capture time are in the latest frame realization known to Geodesy.jl, WGS84 (G1762). Note that this may not be correct if you\'re processing historical data, or Geodesy.jl itself is out of date.  For higher accuracy, you should supply a date of capture - either with each coordinate, or explicitly using the GpsWeek parameter to the WGS84 type:\n\nWGS84{GpsWeek}()\n\nConstruct an object representing the static WGS84 datum computed using data gathered prior to the given GpsWeek.  WGS84 is maintained and updated by the US National Geospatial-Intelligence-Agency (NGA) at irregular intervals to align with the ITRF to within 0.1m (see [1]); if you care about accuracy at that level, you probably want to be solving for position in a different datum, for example, ITRF.  As of 2016, GpsWeek should be one out of [0, 730, 873, 1150, 1674, 1762].\n\nNote that the dates of implementation of these frames as broadcast by the satellites are not the same as the associated GPS week - see Ref.

The time to do a datum shift is when you want to compare information from two different datums.\n\nWhy all this bother about inaccuracy? The errors are twofold: First, the parameters of a datum shift come from a physical measurement process. Typically this involves measuring the coordinates of some physical locations in both datums, and a physical measurement procedure is always subject to some inaccuracy. Second, these tie points are used to infer a compact representation of the datum shift, with as few numerical parameters as possible. A small number of parameters will result in an overly smooth representation; this modelling error is a second source of inaccuracy.  Both these errors can be reduced if you choose to measure more tie points or improve the complexity of the numerical model at a future date.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
