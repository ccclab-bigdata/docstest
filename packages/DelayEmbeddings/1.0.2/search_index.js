The mutual information values are returned in a vector of the same length as τs.\n\nIf any of the optional keyword parameters is given, the grid will be a homogeneous partition of the space where s and sτ are defined. The margins of that partition will be divided in a number of bins equal to nbins, such that the width of each bin will be binwidth, and the range of nonzero values of s will be in the centre. If only of those two parameters is given, the other will be automatically calculated to adjust the size of the grid to the area where s and sτ are nonzero.\n\nIf no parameter is given, the space will be partitioned by a recursive bisection algorithm based on the method given in [1].\n\nNotice that the recursive method of [1] evaluates the joint frequencies of s and sτ in each cell resulting from a partition, and stops when the data points are uniformly distributed across the sub-partitions of the following levels.
