    "text": "Revise.jl may help you keep your Julia sessions running longer, reducing the need to restart when you make changes to code. With Revise, you can be in the middle of a session and then edit source code, update packages, switch git branches, and/or stash/unstash code; typically, the changes will be incorporated into the very next command you issue from the REPL. This can save you the overhead of restarting, loading packages, and waiting for code to JIT-compile."

With Revise, you canfix the bug while simultaneously developing a high-quality test\nverify that your test passes with the fixed code\ngit stash your fix and check that your new test fails on the old code, thus verifying that your test captures the essence of the former bug (if it doesn\'t fail, you need a better test!)\ngit stash pop, test again, commit, and submitall without restarting your Julia session."

Because NFS doesn\'t support inotify, if your code is stored on an NFS-mounted volume you should force Revise to use polling: Revise will periodically (every 5s) scan the modification times of each dependent file. You turn on polling by setting the environment variable JULIA_REVISE_POLL to the string \"1\" (e.g., JULIA_REVISE_POLL=1 in a bash script).If you\'re using polling, you may have to wait several seconds before changes take effect.

Note that some test failures may not really matter to you personally: if, for example, you don\'t plan on hacking on Julia\'s compiler then you may not be concerned about failures related to Revise.track(Core.Compiler). However, because Revise is used by Rebugger and it is common to step into Base methods while debugging, there may be more cases than you might otherwise expect in which you might wish for Revise\'s more \"advanced\" functionality.In the majority of cases, failures come down to Revise having trouble locating source code on your drive. This problem should be fixable, because Revise includes functionality to update its links to source files, as long as it knows what to do.Here are some possible test warnings and errors, and steps you might take to fix them:Error: Package Example not found in current path: This (tiny) package is only used for testing purposes, and gets installed automatically if you do pkg> test Revise, but not if you include(\"runtests.jl\") from inside Revise\'s test/ directory. You can prevent the error with pkg> add Example.\nBase & stdlib file paths: Test Failed at /some/path...  Expression: isfile(Revise.basesrccache) This failure is quite serious, and indicates that you will be unable to access code in Base. To fix this, look for a file called \"base.cache\" somewhere in your Julia install or build directory (for the author, it is at /home/tim/src/julia-1.0/usr/share/julia/base.cache). Now compare this with the value of Revise.basesrccache. (If you\'re getting this failure, presumably they are different.) An important \"top level\" directory is Sys.BINDIR; if they differ already at this level, consider adding a symbolic link from the location pointed at by Sys.BINDIR to the corresponding top-level directory in your actual Julia installation. You\'ll know you\'ve succeeded in specifying it correctly when, after restarting Julia, Revise.basesrccache points to the correct file and Revise.juliadir points to the directory that contains base/. If this workaround is not possible or does not succeed, please file an issue with a description of why you can\'t use it and/or\ndetails from versioninfo and information about how you obtained your Julia installation;\nthe values of Revise.basesrccache and Revise.juliadir, and the actual paths to base.cache and the directory containing the running Julia\'s base/;\nwhat you attempted when trying to fix the problem;\nif possible, your best understanding of why this failed to fix it.\nskipping Core.Compiler and stdlibs tests due to lack of git repo: this likely indicates that you downloaded a Julia binary rather than building Julia from source. While Revise should be able to access the code in Base, at the current time it is not possible for Revise to access julia\'s stdlibs unless you clone Julia\'s repository and build it from source.\nskipping git tests because Revise is not under development: this warning should be harmless. Revise has built-in functionality for extracting source code using git, and it uses itself (i.e., its own git repository) for testing purposes. These tests run only if you have checked out Revise for development (pkg> dev Revise) or on the continuous integration servers (Travis and Appveyor)."

    "title": "Method deletion",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Sometimes you might wish to change a method\'s type signature or number of arguments, or remove a method specialized for specific types. To prevent \"stale\" methods from being called by dispatch, Revise automatically accommodates method deletion, for example:f(x) = 1\nf(x::Int) = 2 # delete this methodIf you save the file, the next time you call f(5) from the REPL you will get 1, and methods(f) will show a single method. Revise even handles more complex situations, such as functions with default arguments: the definitiondefaultargs(x, y=0, z=1.0f0) = x + y + zgenerates 3 different methods (with one, two, and three arguments respectively), and editing this definition todefaultargs(x, yz=(0,1.0f0)) = x + yz[1] + yz[2]requires that we delete all 3 of the original methods and replace them with two new methods.However, to find the right method(s) to delete, Revise needs to be able to parse source code to extract the signature of the to-be-deleted method(s). Unfortunately, a few valid constructs are quite difficult to parse properly. For example, methods generated with code:for T in (Int, Float64, String)   # edit this line to `for T in (Int, Float64)`\n    @eval mytypeof(x::$T) = $T\nendwill not disappear from the method lists until you restart.note: Note\nTo delete a method manually, you can use m = @which foo(args...) to obtain a method, and then call Base.delete_method(m)."

Here\'s an example showing how you do that manually (without using Revise):julia> convert(Float64, π)\n3.141592653589793\n\njulia> # That\'s too hard, let\'s make life easier for students\n\njulia> @eval Base convert(::Type{Float64}, x::Irrational{:π}) = 3.0\nconvert (generic function with 714 methods)\n\njulia> convert(Float64, π)\n3.0Revise removes some of the tedium of manually copying and pasting code into @eval statements. To decrease the amount of re-JITting required, Revise avoids reloading entire modules; instead, it takes care to eval only the changes in your package(s), much as you would if you were doing it manually. Importantly, changes are detected in a manner that is independent of the specific line numbers in your code, so that you don\'t have to re-evaluate just because code moves around within the same file. (One unfortunate side effect is that line numbers may become inaccurate in backtraces, but Revise takes pains to correct these, see below.)To accomplish this, Revise uses the following overall strategy:add callbacks to Base so that Revise gets notified when new packages are loaded or new files included\nprepare source-code caches for every new file. These caches will allow Revise to detect changes when files are updated. For precompiled packages this happens on an as-needed basis, using the cached source in the *.ji file. For non-precompiled packages, Revise parses the source for each included file immediately so that the initial state is known and changes can be detected.\nmonitor the file system for changes to any of the dependent files; it immediately appends any updates to a list of file names that need future processing\nintercept the REPL\'s backend to ensure that the list of files-to-be-revised gets processed each time you execute a new command at the REPL\nwhen a revision is triggered, the source file(s) are re-parsed, and a diff between the cached version and the new version is created. eval the diff in the appropriate module(s).\nreplace the cached version of each source file with the new version, so that further changes are diffed against the most recent update."

    "text": "(Image: diagram)Figure notes: Nodes represent primary objects in Julia\'s compilation pipeline. Arrows and their labels represent functions or data structures that allow you to move from one node to another. Red (\"destructive\") paths force recompilation of dependent functions.Revise bridges between text files (your source code) and compiled code. Revise consequently maintains data structures that parallel Julia\'s own internal processing of code. When dealing with a source-code file, you start with strings, parse them to obtain Julia expressions, evaluate them to obtain Julia objects, and (where appropriate, e.g., for methods) compile them to machine code. This will be called the forward workflow. Revise sets up a few key structures that allow it to progress from files to modules to Julia expressions and types.Revise also sets up a backward workflow, proceeding from compiled code to Julia types back to Julia expressions. This workflow is useful, for example, when dealing with errors: the stack traces displayed by Julia link from the compiled code back to the source files. To make this possible, Julia builds \"breadcrumbs\" into compiled code that store the filename and line number at which each expression was found. However, these links are static, meaning they are set up once (when the code is compiled) and are not updated when the source file changes. Because trivial manipulations to source files (e.g., the insertion of blank lines and/or comments) can change the line number of an expression without necessitating its recompilation, Revise implements a way of correcting these line numbers before they are displayed to the user. This capability requires that Revise proceed backward from the compiled objects to something resembling the original text file."

    "text": "A few convenience terms are used throughout: definition, signature-expression, and signature-type. These terms are illustrated using the following example:<p><pre><code class=\"language-julia\">function <mark>print_item(io::IO, item, ntimes::Integer=1, pre::String=\"\")</mark>\n    print(io, pre)\n    for i = 1:ntimes\n        print(io, item)\n    end\nend</code></pre></p>This represents the definition of a method. Definitions are stored as expressions, using a Revise.RelocatableExpr. The highlighted portion is the signature-expression, specifying the name, argument names and their types, and (if applicable) type-parameters of the method.From the signature-expression we can generate one or more signature-types. Since this function has two default arguments, this signature-expression generates three signature-types, each corresponding to a different valid way of calling this method:Tuple{typeof(print_item),IO,Any}                    # print_item(io, item)\nTuple{typeof(print_item),IO,Any,Integer}            # print_item(io, item, 2)\nTuple{typeof(print_item),IO,Any,Integer,String}     # print_item(io, item, 2, \"  \")In Revise\'s internal code, a definition is often represented with a variable def, a signature-expression with sigex, and a signature-type with sigt."

    "text": "Two \"maps\" are central to Revise\'s inner workings: the DefMap links definition=>signature-types (the forward workflow), while the SigtMap links from signature-type=>definition (the backward workflow). Concretely, SigtMap is just a Dict mapping sigt=>def. Of note, a stack frame typically contains a link to a method, which stores the equivalent of sigt; consequently, this information allows one to look up the corresponding def.The DefMap is a bit more complex and has important constraints:For expressions that do not define a method, it is just def=>nothing\nFor expressions that do define a method, it is def=>([sigt1, ...], lineoffset). [sigt1, ...] is the list of signature-types generated from def (often just one, but more in the case of methods with default arguments). lineoffset is the correction to be added to the currently-compiled code\'s internal line numbers needed to make them match the current state of the source file.\nDefMap is represented as an OrderedDict so as to preserve the sequence in which expressions occur in the file. This can be important particularly for updating macro definitions, which affect the expansion of later code. The order is maintained so as to match the current ordering of the source-file, which is not necessarily the same as the ordering when these expressions were last evaled.\nEach key in the DefMap (the definition RelocatableExpr) is the most recently evaled version of the expression. This has an important consequence: the line numbers in the def (which are still present, even though not used for equality comparisons) correspond to the ones in compiled code. If the file is parsed again, comparing the line numbers embedded in two \"equal\" def exprs (the original and the new one) allows us to accurately determine the current value of lineoffset.Importantly, modules can be \"reconstructed\" from the keys of DefMap (or collection of DefMaps, if the module involves multiple files or has sub-modules), since they hold the complete ordered set of expressions that would be evaled to define the module.The DefMap and SigtMap are grouped in a Revise.FMMaps, which are then organized by the file in which they occur and their module of evaluation."

Because indents.jl only contains code from a single module (Items), the Dict has just one entry. fmm1 looks like this:fmm1 = FMMaps(DefMap(:(indent(::UInt16) = 2) => ([Tuple{typeof(indent),UInt16}], 0),\n                     :(indent(::UInt8) = 4)  => ([Tuple{typeof(indent),UInt8}], 0)\n                     ),\n              SigtMap(Tuple{typeof(indent),UInt16} => :(indent(::UInt16) = 2),\n                      Tuple{typeof(indent),UInt8}  => :(indent(::UInt8) = 4)\n                      ))The lineoffsets are initially set to 0 when the code is first compiled, but these may be updated if the source file is changed.Items.jl is represented with a bit more complexity, \"Items.jl\"=>Dict(Main=>fmm2, Main.Items=>fmm3). This is because Items.jl contains one expression (the __precompile__ statement) that is evaled in Main, and other expressions that are evaled in Items.

The following actions are taken:if a def entry in fmref is equal to one fmnew, the expression is \"unchanged\" except possibly for line number. The lineoffset in fmref is updated as needed.\nif a def entry in fmref is not present in fmnew, that entry is deleted and any corresponding methods are also deleted.\nif a def entry in fmnew is not present in fmref, it is evaled and then added to fmref.Technically, a new fmref is generated every time to ensure that the expressions are ordered as in fmnew; however, conceptually this is better thought of as an updating of fmref, after which fmnew is discarded."

This is applicable only for precompiled modules and Base. (This cache file is distinct from the original source file that might be edited by the developer, and it will always hold the state of the code when the package was precompiled or Julia\'s Base was built.) When a cache is available, fm will be empty until the file gets edited: the original source code gets parsed only when a revision needs to be made.\n\nSource cache files greatly reduce the overhead of using Revise.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
