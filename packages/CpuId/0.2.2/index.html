   ...</code></pre><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Features-1" href="#Features-1">Features</a></h2><p>This release covers a selection of fundamental and higher level functionality:</p><ul><li><code>cpuinfo()</code> generates the summary shown above (markdown string).</li><li><code>cpubrand()</code>, <code>cpumodel()</code>, <code>cpuvendor()</code> allow the identification of the   CPU.</li><li><code>cpuarchitecture()</code> tries to infer the microarchitecture, currently only of   Intel CPUs.</li><li><code>cpucores()</code> and <code>cputhreads()</code> to determine the number of physical and   logical cores on the currently executing CPU, which typically share L3   caches and main memory bandwidth.  If the result of both functions is   equal, then the CPU does <em>not</em> use of hyperthreading.</li><li><code>address_size()</code> and <code>physical_address_size()</code> return the number of bits used   in pointers.  Useful when stealing a few bits from a pointer.</li><li><code>cachelinesize()</code> gives the size in bytes of one cache line, which is   typically 64 bytes.</li><li><code>cachesize()</code> returns a tuple with the sizes of the data caches in bytes.</li><li><code>cpu_base_frequency()</code>, <code>cpu_max_frequency()</code>, <code>cpu_bus_frequency()</code> give -   if supported by the CPU, the base, maximum and bus clock frequencies.   Use <code>has_cpu_frequencies()</code> to check whether this property is supported.</li><li><code>hypervised()</code> returns true when the CPU indicates that a hypervisor is   running the operating system, aka a virtual machine.  In that case,   <code>hvvendor()</code> may be invoked to get the, well, hypervisor vendor, and   <code>hvversion()</code> returns a dictionary of additional version tags.   <code>hvinfo()</code> generates a markdown summary of same dictionary.</li><li><code>simdbits()</code> and <code>simdbytes()</code> return the size of the largest SIMD register   available on the executing CPU.</li><li><code>perf_revision()</code> to query the revision number of hardware performance   monitoring counters, along with <code>perf_fix_counters()</code>, <code>perf_gen_counters()</code>,   <code>perf_fix_bits()</code>, <code>perf_gen_bits()</code> to determine the number and bit width   of available fixed-function and general purpose counters per logical core.</li><li><code>cpucycle()</code> and <code>cpucycle_id()</code> let you directly get the CPU&#39;s time stamp   counter, which is increased for every CPU clock cycle. This is a method to   perform low overhead micro-benchmarking; though, technically, this uses the   <code>rdtsc</code> and <code>rdtscp</code> instructions rather than <code>cpuid</code>.</li><li><code>cpufeature(::Symbol)</code> permits asking for the availability of a specific   feature, and <code>cpufeaturetable()</code> gives a complete overview of all detected   features with a brief explanation, as shown above.</li></ul><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Background-1" href="#Background-1">Background</a></h2><p>The <code>cpuid</code> instruction is a generic way provided by the CPU vendor to obtain basic hardware information.  It provides data in form of boolean bit fields, integer fields and strings, all packed in the returned CPU registers EAX, EBX, ECX and EDX. Which information is returned is determined by the so called leaf, which is defined by setting the input register EAX to a specific 32 bit integer value before executing the instruction.  The extent and kind of information obtainable via this instruction has changed quite a lot over the past decade and still evolves with every CPU generation.  Thus, not all information is available on every CPU model, and certainly everything is vendor dependent.</p><p>This Julia package also provides the <code>cpucycle()</code> function which allows getting the current time stamp counter (TSC) by emitting a <code>rdtsc</code> instruction. Similarly to <code>cpuid</code>, it only requires CPU registers and is usable in user-land code and facilitates an alternative approach to micro-benchmarking.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Limitations-1" href="#Limitations-1">Limitations</a></h2><p>The behaviour on non-Intel CPUs is currently unknown; though technically a crash of Julia could be expected, theoretically, a rather large list of CPUs support the <code>cpuid</code> instruction. Tip: Just try it and report back.</p><p>There are plenty of different CPUs, and in particular the <code>cpuid</code> instruction has numerous corner cases, which this package does not address, yet.</p><p>Moreover, the <code>cpuid</code> instruction can only provide information for the executing physical CPU, called a package.  To obtain information on all packages, and all physical and logical cores, the executing program must be pinned sequentially to each and every core, and gather its properties. This is how <code>libuv</code>, <code>hwloc</code> or the operating system obtain that kind information.  However, this would require additional external or operating system dependent code which is not the scope of this package.</p><h4><a class="nav-anchor" id="Specific-limitations-1" href="#Specific-limitations-1">Specific limitations</a></h4><ul><li><p>Why aren&#39;t all infos available that are seen e.g. in <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code>?   Many of those features, flags and properties reside in the so called machine   specific registers (MSR), which are only accessible to privileged programs   running in the so called <em>ring 0</em>, such as the Linux kernel itself. Thus,   short answer: You&#39;re not allowed to.</p></li><li><p>The results obtained by <code>CpuId</code> functions are inconsistent with my hardware!   Try other programs whether they give the same information or differ. If they   differ, then you found a bug.  See below for some   <a href="#alternatives">alternatives</a>, in particular the Linux command line tool   <em>cpuid</em>.</p></li><li><p>When running a hypervisor (virtual machine) the presented information is wrong!   Hypervisor vendors are free to provide the <code>cpuid</code> information   by intercepting calls to that instruction.  Not all vendors comply, and some   even permit the user to change what is reported.  Thus, expect some   surprises when a hypervisor is detected.</p></li><li><p>My hypervisor is not detected!   Either you&#39;re not really running a hypervisor, e.g. <em>Bash on Windows</em> is   <em>not</em> a virtual machine, or there is a feature missing. Raise an issue on   GitHub.</p></li><li><p><code>cpucycles()</code> invokes <code>rdtsc</code>; that is not <code>cpuid</code>!   True. However, both are valuable when diagnosing performance issues   and trying to perform micro benchmarks on specific hardware.</p></li></ul><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Alternatives-1" href="#Alternatives-1">Alternatives</a></h2><p>On Linux, most of the information may be obtained by reading from the <code>/proc</code> tree, in particular <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code>, which eventually also invokes the <code>cpuid</code> instruction.  Type <code>man 4 cpuid</code> to get a brief description of this kernel driver.</p><p>On many Linux distributions, there is also the command line tool <a href=" http:/www.etallen.com/cpuid.html">cpuid</a>, which essentially does exactly the same.  On Ubuntu, you would install it using <code>sudo apt install cpuid</code>, then use it to show a summary by simply typing <code>cpuid</code>.</p><p>Then, of course, there are a few functions in Julia Base. These are <code>Base.Sys.cpu_info()</code>, and <code>Base.Sys.cpu_summary()</code>, as well as the global variables <code>Base.Sys.CPU_CORES</code>, and <code>Base.Sys.cpu_name</code>.  These are mostly provided by wrapping <em>libuv</em>.  In particular <code>CPU_CORES</code> is the reason for this module: It&#39;s intrinsically unclear whether that number includes hyperthreading cores, or whether it is referring to real physical cores of the current machine.</p><p>The Julia package <a href="https://github.com/JuliaParallel/Hwloc.jl">Hwloc.jl</a> provides similar and more information primarily directed towards the topology of your CPUs, viz.  number of CPU packages, physical &amp; logical cores and associated caches, along with a number of features to deal with thread affinity. However, it also pulls in additional external binary dependencies in that it relies on <a href="https://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/">hwloc</a>, which also implies quite some computational overhead. Whether this is an issue in the first place depends much on your use-case.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Terms-of-usage-1" href="#Terms-of-usage-1">Terms of usage</a></h2><p>This Julia package <em>CpuId</em> is published as open source and licensed under the <a href="LICENSE.md">MIT &quot;Expat&quot; License</a>.</p><p><strong>Contributions welcome!</strong></p><p>You&#39;re welcome to report successful usage or any issues via GitHub, and to open pull requests to extend the current functionality.</p><footer><hr/><a class="next" href="autodocs/"><span class="direction">Next</span><span class="title">Docstrings</span></a></footer></article></body></html>
