    "title": "Introduction to Rebugger",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Rebugger is an expression-level debugger for Julia. It has no ability to interact with or manipulate call stacks (see ASTInterpreter2), but it can trace execution via the manipulation of Julia expressions.The name \"Rebugger\" has 3 meanings:it is a REPL-based debugger (more on that below)\nit is the Revise-based debugger\nit supports repeated-execution \"surface\" debuggingRebugger is an unusual debugger with a novel work-flow paradigm. With most debuggers, you enter some special mode that lets the user \"dive into the code,\" but what you are allowed to do while in this special mode may be limited. In contrast, Rebugger brings the code along with its input arguments to the user, presenting them both for inspection, analysis, and editing in the (mostly) normal Julia interactive command line. As a consequence, you can:test different modifications to the code or arguments without being forced to exit debug mode and save your file\nrun the same chosen block of code repeatedly (perhaps with different modifications each time) without having to repeat any of the \"setup\" work that might have been necessary to get to some deeply nested method in the original call stack. In other words, Rebugger brings \"internal\" methods to the surface.\nrun any desired command that helps you understand the nature of a bug. For example, if you\'ve already loaded MyFavoritePlottingPackage in your session, then when debugging you can (transiently) add Main.MyFavoritePlottingPackage.plot(x, y) as a line of the method-body you are currently analyzing, and you should see a plot of the requested variables.Rebugger exploits the Julia REPL\'s history capabilities to simulate the stacktrace-navigation features of graphical debuggers. Thus Rebugger offers a command-line experience that is more closely aligned with graphical debuggers than the traditional s, n, up, c commands of a console debugger."

    "text": "Most of Rebugger\'s functionality gets triggered by special keyboard shortcuts added to Julia\'s REPL. Unfortunately, different operating systems and desktop environments vary considerably in their key bindings, and it is possible that the default choices in Rebugger are already assigned other meanings on your platform. There does not appear to be any one set of choices that works on all platforms.The best strategy is to try the demos in Usage; if the default shortcuts are already taken on your platform, then you can easily configure Rebugger to use different bindings (see Configuration).Some platforms are known to require or benefit from special attention:"

Currently there are exactly two keybindings, which here will be described as:Meta-e, which maps to \"enter\" or \"step in\"\nMeta-s, which maps to \"stacktrace\" (for commands that throw an error)Meta often maps to Esc, and if using Esc you should hit the two keys in sequence rather than simultaneously. For many users Alt (sometimes specifically Left-Alt, or Option on macs) may be more convenient, as it can be pressed simultaneously with the key.Of course, you may have configured Rebugger to use different key bindings (see Customize keybindings)."

Now if you hit Meta-e, you should see something like this:<img src=\"images/stepin2.png\" width=\"822px\"/>(If not, check Keyboard shortcuts and Customize keybindings.) The cyan \"Info\" line is an indication that the method you\'re stepping into is a function in Julia\'s Base module; this is shown by Revise (not Rebugger), and only happens once per session.The remaining lines correspond to the Rebugger header and user input. The magenta line tells you which method you are stepping into. Indented blue line(s) show the value(s) of any input arguments or type parameters.If you\'re following along, move your cursor to the next show call as illustrated above. Hit Meta-e again. You should see a new show method, this time with two input arguments.Now let\'s demonstrate another important display item: position your cursor at the beginning of the _show_empty call and hit Meta-e. The display should now look like this:<img src=\"images/stepin3.png\" width=\"859px\"/>This time, note the yellow/orange line: this is a warning message, and you should pay attention to these. (You might also see red lines, which are generally more serious \"errors.\") In this case execution never reached _show_empty, because it enters show_vector instead; if you moved your cursor there, you could trace execution more completely.Having illustrated the importance of \"point\" and the various colors used for messages from Rebugger, to ensure readability the remaining examples will be rendered as text."

Then, press Ctrl+D twice to terminate the input.

    "text": "Rebugger removes the function and arguments from Rebugger.stashed[] and then uses which to determine the specific method called. It then asks Revise for the expression that defines the method. It then analyzes the signature to determine the full complement of inputs and creates a new method that stores them. For example, if the applicable method of fcomplex is given by    function fcomplex(x::A, y=1, z=\"\"; kw1=3.2) where A<:AbstractArray{T} where T\n        # <body>\n    endthen Rebugger generates a new method    function hidden_fcomplex(x::A, y=1, z=\"\"; kw1=3.2) where A<:AbstractArray{T} where T\n        Main.Rebugger.stored[uuid] = Main.Rebugger.Stored(fcomplex, (:x, :y, :z, :kw1, :A, :T), deepcopy((x, y, z, kw1, A, T)))\n        throw(StopException())\n    endThis method is then called from inside another try/catch block that again checks for a StopException. This results in the complete set of inputs being stored, a more \"permanent\" form of preservation than stashing, which only lasts for the gap between caller and callee capture. If one has the appropriate uuid, one can then extract these values at will from storage using Rebugger.getstored."

To make this easier, Rebugger replaces the contents of the buffer with a line that looks like this:@eval <ModuleOf_fcomplex> let (x, y, z, kw1, A, T) = Main.Rebugger.getstored(\"0123abc...\")\n    # <body>\nendThe @eval makes sure that the block will be executed within the module in which fcomplex is defined; as a consequence it will have access to all the unexported methods, etc., that fcomplex itself has. The let block ensures that these variables do not conflict with other objects that may be defined in ModuleOf_fcomplex. The values are unloaded from the store (making copies, in case fcomplex modifies its inputs) and then execution proceeds into body.The user can then edit the buffer at will."
