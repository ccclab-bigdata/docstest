    "text": "TaylorSeries.jl is an implementation of high-order automatic differentiation, as presented in the book by W. Tucker [1]. The general idea is the following.The Taylor series expansion of an analytical function f(t) with one independent variable t around t_0 can be written asbeginequation\nf(t) = f_0 + f_1 (t-t_0) + f_2 (t-t_0)^2 + cdots + f_k (t-t_0)^k + cdots\nendequationwhere f_0=f(t_0), and the Taylor coefficients f_k = f_k(t_0) are the k-th normalized derivatives at t_0:beginequation\nf_k = frac1k fracrm d^k f rm d t^k(t_0)\nendequationThus, computing the high-order derivatives of f(t) is equivalent to computing its Taylor expansion.In the case of many independent variables the same statements hold, though things become more subtle. Following Alex Haro\'s approach [2], the Taylor expansion is an infinite sum of homogeneous polynomials in the d independent variables x_1 x_2 dots x_d, which takes the formbeginequation\nf_k (mathbfx_0) = sum_m_1+cdots+m_d = k f_m_1dotsm_d \n(x_1-x_0_1)^m_1 cdots (x_d-x_0_d)^m_d =\nsum_mathbfm=k f_mathbfm (mathbfx-mathbfx_0)^mathbfm\nendequationHere, mathbfmin mathbbN^d is a multi-index of the k-th order homogeneous polynomial and mathbfx=(x_1x_2ldotsx_d) are the d independent variables.In both cases, a Taylor series expansion can be represented by a vector containing its coefficients. The difference between the cases of one or more independent variables is that the coefficients are real or complex numbers in the former case, but homogeneous polynomials in the latter case. This motivates the construction of the Taylor1 and TaylorN types."

    "text": "Consider a function y(t) that satisfies the ordinary differential equation doty = f(y), y(t_0)=y_0, where t is the independent variable.

    "text": "Taylor expansions in one variable are represented by the Taylor1 type, which consists of a vector of coefficients (fieldname coeffs) and the maximum order considered for the expansion (fieldname order). The coefficients are arranged in ascending order with respect to the degree of the monomial, so that coeffs[1] is the constant term, coeffs[2] gives the first order term (t^1), etc. Yet, it is possible to have the natural ordering with respect to the degree; see below. This is a dense representation of the polynomial. The order of the polynomial can be omitted in the constructor, which is then fixed by the length of the vector of coefficients. If the length of the vector does not correspond with the order, order is used, which effectively truncates polynomial to degree order.Taylor1([1, 2, 3],4) # Polynomial of order 4 with coefficients 1, 2, 3\nTaylor1([0.0, 1im]) # Also works with complex numbers\nTaylor1(ones(8), 2) # Polynomial truncated to order 2\nshift_taylor(a) = a + Taylor1(typeof(a),5)  ## a + taylor-polynomial of order 5\nt = shift_taylor(0.0) # Independent variable `t`Note that the information about the maximum order considered is displayed using a big-ùí™ notation. In some cases, it is desirable to not display the big-ùí™ notation. The function displayBigO allows to control whether it is displayed or not.displayBigO(false) # turn-off displaying big O notation\nt\ndisplayBigO(true) # turn it on\ntSimilarly, it is possible to control if the format of the displayed series through the function use_show_default; use_show_default(true) uses the Base.show_default, while use_show_default(false) uses the custom display form (default).use_show_default(true) # use Base.show method\nt\nuse_show_default(false) # use custom `show`\ntThe definition of shift_taylor(a) uses the method Taylor1([::Type{Float64}], [order::Int=1]), which is a shortcut to define the independent variable of a Taylor expansion, of given type and order (defaults are Float64 and order=1). This is one of the easiest ways to work with the package.The usual arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, ^, ==) have been extended to work with the Taylor1 type, including promotions that involve Numbers. The operations return a valid Taylor expansion of maximum order. This is apparent in the last example below, where the answer is beyond the order of the expansion.t*(3t+2.5)\n1/(1-t)\nt*(t^2-4)/(t+2)\ntI = im*t\n(1-t)^3.2\n(1+t)^t\nt^6  # t is of order 5If no valid Taylor expansion can be computed, an error is thrown, for instance when a derivative is not defined (or simply diverges):1/t\nt^3.2\nabs(t)Several elementary functions have been implemented; their coefficients are computed recursively. At the moment of this writing, these functions are exp, log, sqrt, the trigonometric functions sin, cos and tan, their inverses, as well as the hyperbolic functions sinh, cosh and tanh and their inverses; more will be added in the future. Note that this way of obtaining the Taylor coefficients is not the laziest way, in particular for many independent variables. Yet, it is quite efficient, especially for the integration of ordinary differential equations, which is among the applications we have in mind (see also TaylorIntegration.jl).exp(t)\nlog(1-t)\nsqrt(1 + t)\nimag(exp(tI)\')\nreal(exp(Taylor1([0.0,1im],17))) - cos(Taylor1([0.0,1.0],17)) == 0.0\nconvert(Taylor1{Rational{Int}}, exp(t))Again, errors are thrown whenever it is necessary.sqrt(t)\nlog(t)To obtain a specific coefficient, getcoeff can be used. Another alternative is to request the specific degree using the vector notation, where the index corresponds to the degree of the term.expon = exp(t)\ngetcoeff(expon, 0) == expon[0]\nrationalize(expon[3])Differentiating and integrating is straightforward for polynomial expansions in one variable, using derivative and integrate. (The function differentiate is an exact synonym of derivative.) These functions return the corresponding Taylor1 expansions. The last coefficient of a derivative is set to zero to keep the same order as the original polynomial; for the integral, an integration constant may be set by the user (the default is zero). The order of the resulting polynomial is not changed. The value of the n-th (n ge 0) derivative is obtained using derivative(n,a), where a is a Taylor series.derivative(exp(t))\nintegrate(exp(t))\nintegrate( exp(t), 1.0)\nintegrate( derivative( exp(-t)), 1.0 ) == exp(-t)\nderivative(1, exp(shift_taylor(1.0))) == exp(1.0)\ndifferentiate(5, exp(shift_taylor(1.0))) == exp(1.0) # 5-th derivative of `exp(1+t)`To evaluate a Taylor series at a given point, Horner\'s rule is used via the function evaluate(a, dt). Here, dt is the increment from the point t_0 around which the Taylor expansion of a is calculated, i.e., the series is evaluated at t = t_0 + dt. Omitting dt corresponds to dt = 0; see evaluate.evaluate(exp(shift_taylor(1.0))) - ‚ÑØ # exp(t) around t0=1 (order 5), evaluated there (dt=0)\nevaluate(exp(t), 1) - ‚ÑØ # exp(t) around t0=0 (order 5), evaluated at t=1\nevaluate(exp( Taylor1(17) ), 1) - ‚ÑØ # exp(t) around t0=0, order 17\ntBig = Taylor1(BigFloat, 50) # Independent variable with BigFloats, order 50\neBig = evaluate( exp(tBig), one(BigFloat) )\n‚ÑØ - eBigAnother way to obtain the value of a Taylor1 polynomial p at a given value x, is to call p as if it were a function, i.e., p(x):t = Taylor1(15)\np = sin(t)\nevaluate(p, pi/2) # value of p at pi/2 using `evaluate`\np(pi/2) # value of p at pi/2 by evaluating p as a function\np(pi/2) == evaluate(p, pi/2)\np(0.0)\np() == p(0.0) # p() is a shortcut to obtain the 0-th order coefficient of `p`Note that the syntax p(x) is equivalent to evaluate(p, x), whereas p() is equivalent to evaluate(p). For more details about function-like behavior for a given type in Julia, see the Function-like objects section of the Julia manual.Useful shortcuts are taylor_expand are update!. The former returns the expansion of a function around a given value t0. In turn, update! provides an in-place update of a given Taylor polynomial, that is, it shifts it further by the provided amount.p = taylor_expand( x -> sin(x), pi/2, order=16) # 16-th order expansion of sin(t) around pi/2\nupdate!(p, 0.025) # updates the expansion given by p, by shifting it further by 0.025\np"

    "text": "A polynomial in N1 variables can be represented in (at least) two ways: As a vector whose coefficients are homogeneous polynomials of fixed degree, or as a vector whose coefficients are polynomials in N-1 variables. The current implementation of TaylorSeries.jl corresponds to the first option, though some infrastructure has been built that permits to develop the second one. An elegant (lazy) implementation of the second representation was discussed  here.The structure TaylorN is constructed as a vector of parameterized homogeneous polynomials defined by the type HomogeneousPolynomial, which in turn is a vector of coefficients of given order (degree). This implementation imposes the user to specify the (maximum) order considered and the number of independent variables at the beginning, which can be conveniently done using set_variables. A vector of the resulting Taylor variables is returned:x, y = set_variables(\"x y\")\ntypeof(x)\nx.order\nx.coeffsAs shown, the resulting objects are of TaylorN{Float64} type. There is an optional order keyword argument in set_variables, used to specify the maximum order of the TaylorN polynomials. Note that one can specify the variables using a vector of symbols.set_variables([:x, :y], order=10)Similarly, numbered variables are also available by specifying a single variable name and the optional keyword argument numvars:set_variables(\"Œ±\", numvars=3)Alternatively to set_variables, get_variables can be used if one doesn\'t want to change internal dictionaries. get_variables returns a vector of TaylorN independent variables of a desired order (lesser than get_order so the internals doesn\'t have to change) with the length and variable names defined by set_variables initially.get_variables(2) # vector of independent variables of order 2The function show_params_TaylorN displays the current values of the parameters, in an info block.show_params_TaylorN()Internally, changing the parameters (maximum order and number of variables) redefines the hash-tables that translate the index of the coefficients of a HomogeneousPolynomial of given order into the corresponding multi-variable monomials, or the other way around. Fixing these values from the start is imperative; the initial (default) values are order = 6 and num_vars=2.The easiest way to construct a TaylorN object is by defining the independent variables. This can be done using set_variables as above, or through the method TaylorN{T<:Number}(::Type{T}, nv::Int) for the nv independent TaylorN{T} variable; the order can be also specified using the optional keyword argument order.x, y = set_variables(\"x y\", numvars=2, order=6);\nx\nTaylorN(1, order=4) # variable 1 of order 4\nTaylorN(Int, 2)    # variable 2, type Int, order=get_order()=6Other ways of constructing TaylorN polynomials involve using HomogeneousPolynomial objects directly, which is uncomfortable.set_variables(:x, numvars=2); # symbols can be used\nHomogeneousPolynomial([1,-1])\nTaylorN([HomogeneousPolynomial([1,0]), HomogeneousPolynomial([1,2,3])],4)The Taylor expansions are implemented around 0 for all variables; if the expansion is needed around a different value, the trick is a simple translation of the corresponding independent variable, i.e. x to x+a.As before, the usual arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, ^, ==) have been extended to work with TaylorN objects, including the appropriate promotions to deal with numbers. (Some of the arithmetic operations have been extended for HomogeneousPolynomial, whenever the result is a HomogeneousPolynomial; division, for instance, is not extended.)Also, the elementary functions have been implemented, again by computing their coefficients recursively:x, y = set_variables(\"x y\", order=10);\nexy = exp(x+y)The function getcoeff gives the normalized coefficient of the polynomial that corresponds to the monomial specified by the tuple or vector v containing the powers. For instance, for the polynomial exy above, the coefficient of the monomial x^3 y^5 is obtained using getcoeff(exy, (3,5)) or getcoeff(exy, [3,5]).getcoeff(exy, (3,5))\nrationalize(ans)Similar to Taylor1, vector notation can be used to request specific coefficients of HomogeneousPolynomial or TaylorN objects. For TaylorN objects, the index refers to the degree of the HomogeneousPolynomial. In the case of HomogeneousPolynomial the index refers to the position of the hash table. The function show_monomials can be used to obtain the coefficient a specific monomial, given the degree of the HomogeneousPolynomial.exy[8] # get the 8th order term\nshow_monomials(8)\nexy[8][6] # get the 6th coeff of the 8th order termPartial differentiation is also implemented for TaylorN objects, through the function derivative, specifying the number of the variable, or its symbol, as the second argument.p = x^3 + 2x^2 * y - 7x + 2\nq = y - x^4\nderivative( p, 1 )   # partial derivative with respect to 1st variable\nderivative( q, :y )  # partial derivative with respect to :yIf we ask for the partial derivative with respect to a non-defined variable, an error is thrown.derivative( q, 3 )   # error, since we are dealing with 2 variablesTo obtain more specific partial derivatives we have two specialized methods that involve a tuple, which represents the number of derivatives with respect to each variable (so the tuple\'s length has to be the same as the actual number of variables). These methods either return the TaylorN object in question, or the coefficient corresponding to the specified tuple, normalized by the factorials defined by the tuple. The latter is in essence the 0-th order coefficient of the former.derivative(p, (2,1)) # two derivatives on :x and one on :y\nderivative((2,1), p) # 0-th order coefficient of the previous expression\nderivative(p, (1,1)) # one derivative on :x and one on :y\nderivative((1,1), p) # 0-th order coefficient of the previous expressionIntegration with respect to the r-th variable for HomogeneousPolynomials and TaylorN objects is obtained using integrate. Note that integrate for TaylorN objects allows to specify a constant of integration, which must be independent from the integrated variable. Again, the integration variable may be specified by its symbol.integrate( derivative( p, 1 ), 1) # integrate with respect to the first variable\nintegrate( derivative( p, 1 ), :x, 2) # integration with respect to :x, constant of integration is 2\nintegrate( derivative( q, 2 ), :y, -x^4) == q\nintegrate( derivative( q, 2 ), 2, y)evaluate can also be used for TaylorN objects, using it on vectors of numbers (Real or Complex); the length of the vector must coincide with the number of independent variables. evaluate also allows to specify only one variable and a value.evaluate(exy, [.1,.02]) == exp(0.12)\nevaluate(exy, :x, 0.0) == exp(y)  # evaluate `exy` for :x -> 0Analogously to Taylor1, another way to obtain the value of a TaylorN polynomial p at a given point x, is to call it as if it were a function: the syntax p(x) for p::TaylorN is equivalent to evaluate(p,x), and p() is equivalent to evaluate(p).exy([.1,.02]) == exp(0.12)\nexy(:x, 0.0)The functions taylor_expand and update! work as well for TaylorN.xysq = x^2 + y^2\nupdate!(xysq, [1.0, -2.0]) # expand around (1,-2)\nxysq\nupdate!(xysq, [-1.0, 2.0]) # shift-back\nxysq == x^2 + y^2Functions to compute the gradient, Jacobian and Hessian have also been implemented; note that these functions are not exported, so its use require the prefix TaylorSeries. Using the polynomials p = x^3 + 2x^2 y - 7 x + 2 and q = y-x^4 defined above, we may use TaylorSeries.gradient (or ‚àá); the results are of type Array{TaylorN{T},1}. To compute the Jacobian and Hessian of a vector field evaluated at a point, we use respectively TaylorSeries.jacobian and TaylorSeries.hessian:‚àá(p)\nTaylorSeries.gradient( q )\nr = p-q-2*p*q\nTaylorSeries.hessian(ans)\nTaylorSeries.jacobian([p,q], [2,1])\nTaylorSeries.hessian(r, [1.0,1.0])Other specific applications are described in the Examples."

We shall also consider the form s^2+s in fateman2, which involves fewer operations (and makes a fairer comparison to what Mathematica does).using TaylorSeries\nconst order = 20\nconst x, y, z, w = set_variables(Int128, \"x\", numvars=4, order=2order)\nfunction fateman1(degree::Int)\n    T = Int128\n    s = one(T) + x + y + z + w\n    s = s^degree\n    s * ( s + one(T) )\nend(In the following lines, which are run when the documentation is built, by some reason the timing appears before the command executed.)@time fateman1(0);\n# hide\n@time f1 = fateman1(20);Another implementation of the same, but exploiting optimizations related to ^2 yields:function fateman2(degree::Int)\n    T = Int128\n    s = one(T) + x + y + z + w\n    s = s^degree\n    s^2 + s\nend\nfateman2(0);\n@time f2 = fateman2(20); # the timing appears aboveWe note that the above functions use expansions in Int128.

    "text": "The functions described above have been compared against Mathematica v11.1. The relevant files used for benchmarking can be found here. Running on a MacPro with Intel-Xeon processors 2.7GHz, we obtain that Mathematica requires on average (5 runs) 3.075957 seconds for the computation, while for fateman1 and fateman2 above we obtain 2.15408 and 1.08337, respectively.Then, with the current version of TaylorSeries.jl and using Julia v0.7.0, our implementation of fateman1 is about 30%-40% faster. (The original test by Fateman corresponds to fateman1 above, which avoids some optimizations related to squaring; the implementation in Mathematica is done such that this optimization does not occur.)"
