    "text": "(Image: Build Status) (Image: Coverage Status) (Image: codecov)(Image: ) (Image: )(Image: Join the chat at https://gitter.im/JuliaIntervals/IntervalArithmetic.jl)IntervalArithmetic.jl is a Julia package for performing Validated Numerics in Julia, i.e. rigorous computations with finite-precision floating-point arithmetic.All calculations are carried out using interval arithmetic: all quantities are treated as intervals, which are propagated throughout a calculation. The final result is an interval that is guaranteed to contain the correct result, starting from the given initial data.The aim of the package is correctness over speed, although performance considerations are also taken into account."

    "text": "The IEEE Std 1788-2015 - IEEE Standard for Interval Arithmetic was published in June 2015. We are working towards having IntervalArithmetic.jl be conformant with this standard.To do so, we have incorporated tests from the excellent ITF1788 test suite, originally written by Marco Nehmeier and Maximilian Kiesner, and converted to a common format and to output tests for Julia by Oliver Heimlich."
