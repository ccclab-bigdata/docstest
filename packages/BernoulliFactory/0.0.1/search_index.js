    "text": "(Image: Build Status) (Image: Build status) (Image: Coverage Status) (Image: codecov.io)This package provides some Bernoulli factory algorithms, and a constrained, unbiased estimation algorithm.Given a function g such that g() returns a Bernoulli(p) variate, and a function f mapping [0,1] -> [0,1] a Bernoulli factory algorithm should use calls to g produce a Bernoulli(f(p)) variate. Not all functions f admit an algorithm (Keane & O\'Brien, 1994), and some algorithms require additional information."
