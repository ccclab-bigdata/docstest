    "title": "What is correct rounding?",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Suppose that we ask Julia to calculate the cosine of a number:julia> cos(0.5)\n0.8775825618903728using the built-in mathematics library, OpenLibm. The result is a floating-point number that is a very good approximation to the true value. However, we do not know if the result that Julia gives is below or above the true value, nor how far away it is.Correctly-rounded functions guarantee that when the result is not exactly representable as a floating-point number, the value returned is the next largest floating-point number, when rounding up, or the next smallest when rounding down. This is equivalent to doing the calculation in infinite precision and then performing the rounding."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "The CRlibm library is state-of-the-art as regards correctly-rounded functions of Float64 arguments. It is required for our interval arithmetic library, ValidatedNumerics. Having gone to the trouble of wrapping it, it made sense to release it separately; for example, it could be used to test the quality of the OpenLibm functions."

    "text": "CRlibm is missing a (guaranteed) correctly-rounded power function (x^y), since the fact that there are two arguments, instead of a single argument for functions such as sin, means that correct rounding is much harder; see e.g. reference [1]  here.[1] P.

    "text": "As far as we are aware, the only alternative package to CRlibm is MPFR. This provides correctly-rounded functions for floating-point numbers of arbitrary precision, including the power function. However, it can be slow.MPFR is wrapped in base Julia in the BigFloat type. It can emulate double-precision floating point by setting the precision to 53 bits, and using setrounding:julia> setprecision(53)\n53\n\njulia> b = setrounding(BigFloat, RoundDown) do\n           a = parse(BigFloat, \"2.1\")\n           a^3\n       end\n9.2609999999999939\n\njulia> c = setrounding(BigFloat, RoundUp) do\n           a = parse(BigFloat, \"2.1\")\n           a^3\n       end\n9.2610000000000028\n"
