It is designed to enable computational evaluation of emerging power network formulations and algorithms in a common platform. The code is engineered to decouple problem specifications (e.g. Power Flow, Optimal Power Flow, ...) from the power network formulations (e.g. AC, DC-approximation, SOC-relaxation, ...). This enables the definition of a wide variety of power network formulations and their comparison on common problem specifications.Core Problem SpecificationsPower Flow (pf)\nOptimal Power Flow (opf)\nOptimal Transmission Switching (ots)\nTransmission Network Expansion Planning (tnep)Core Network FormulationsAC (polar and rectangular coordinates)\nDC Approximation (polar coordinates)\nSOC Relaxation (W-space)\nQC Relaxation (W+L-space)Network Data FormatsMatpower \".m\" files\nPTI \".raw\" files (PSS(R)E v33 specfication)"
