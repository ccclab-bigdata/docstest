    "text": "This code was developed with a mindset of a Financial Institution that has a big Fixed Income portfolio. Many financial contracts, specially Fixed Income instruments, depend on a particular calendar of holidays to determine how many days exist between the valuation date and the maturity of the contract. A Business Days calculator is a small piece of software used to perform this important step of the valuation process. While there are many implementations of Business Days calculators out there, the usual implementation is based on this kind of algorithm:dt0 = initial_date\ndt1 = final_date\nholidays = vector_of_holidays\nbdays = 0\nwhile d0 <= d1\n    if d0 not in holidays\n        bdays = bdays + 1\n    end\n    d0 = d0 + 1\nend whileThis works fine for general use. But the performance becomes an issue if one must repeat this calculation many times. Say you have 50 000 contracts, each contract with 20 cash flows. If you need to apply this algorithm to each cash flow, you will need to perform it 1 000 000 times.For instance, let\'s try out this code using R and QuantLib (RQuantLib):library(RQuantLib)\nlibrary(microbenchmark)\n\nfrom <- as.Date(\"2015-06-29\")\nto <- as.Date(\"2100-12-20\")\nmicrobenchmark(businessDaysBetween(\"Brazil\", from, to))\n\nfrom_vect <- rep(from, 1000000)\nto_vect <- rep(to, 1000000)\nmicrobenchmark(businessDaysBetween(\"Brazil\", from_vect, to_vect), times=1)Running this code, we get the following: (only the fastest execution is shown)Unit: milliseconds\n                                    expr     min\n businessDaysBetween(\"Brazil\", from, to) 1.63803\n\nUnit: seconds\n                                              expr      min\n businessDaysBetween(\"Brazil\", from_vect, to_vect) 1837.476\nWhile one computation takes up to 2 milliseconds, we\'re in trouble if we have to repeat it for the whole portfolio: it takes about half an hour to complete. This is not due to R\'s performance, because RQuantLib is a simple wrapper to QuantLib C++ library.BusinessDays.jl uses a tailor-made cache to store Business Days results, reducing the time spent to the order of a few microseconds for a single computation. Also, the time spent to process the whole portfolio is reduced to under a second.It\'s also important to point out that the initialization of the memory cache, which is done only once for each Julia runtime session, takes less than half a second, including JIT compilation time. Also, the memory footprint required for each cached calendar should take around 0.7 MB.Benchmark Codejulia> using BusinessDays, Dates\n\njulia> d0 = Date(2015, 06, 29) ; d1 = Date(2100, 12, 20) ;\n\njulia> cal = BusinessDays.Brazil()\nBusinessDays.BRSettlement()\n\njulia> @time BusinessDays.initcache(cal)\n  0.161972 seconds (598.85 k allocations: 30.258 MiB, 2.29% gc time)\n\njulia> bdays(cal, d0, d1) # force JIT compilation\n21471 days\n\njulia> @time bdays(cal, d0, d1)\n  0.000012 seconds (9 allocations: 240 bytes)\n21471 days\n\njulia> @time for i in 1:1000000 bdays(cal, d0, d1) end\n  0.221275 seconds (5.00 M allocations: 76.294 MiB, 2.93% gc time)There\'s no magicIf we disable BusinessDays\'s cache, however, the performance is slightly worse than QuantLib\'s implementation. It takes around 38 minutes to process the same benchmark test.julia> BusinessDays.cleancache() # cleans existing cache, if any\n\njulia> @time for i in 1:1000000 bdays(cal, d0, d1) end\n# 2288.906548 seconds (5.00 M allocations: 76.294 MB, 0.00% gc time)It\'s important to point out that cache is disabled by default. So, in order to take advantage of high speed computation provided by this package, one must call BusinessDays.initcache function."
